They excel at making wax until about eight weeks old, then move on to new roles. Bees are adept at learning and can have multiple jobs in their lifetime, ranging from nurse bees and guard bees to foragers. Each role is critical, and bees are promoted through these positions as they age. The lesson? Managers should consider these changing strengths when assigning roles and seek out when employees are ready for a progression.\n* Focus on creating lasting value: Much like focusing on the honey can distract you from thinking long-term about the hive, an overemphasis on current products may hinder disruptive innovations. For instance, solving internet load issues in 1994 led to high-speed internet and the smartphone revolution. Similarly, if we were too focused on the benefits of Wi-Fi alone (the current honey), we would have missed the need for seamless connectivity across Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellite networks. This convergence led to the development of fiber-optic technology, which is now the backbone of high-capacity communication networks. An enterprise mindset is crucial here.

of adulterating honey is well known, and historically adulterants such as ash and potato flour have been used.\n\nNow, advancements in technology and science have made it much easier, with "bespoke, designer or bioengineered" syrups used as diluting agents capable of fooling authenticity tests, Ingram said.\n\nShe founded the UK Honey Authenticity Network (HAN UK) in 2021 to raise awareness about

regulations to ensure clearer product labelling and a "honey traceability system" to increase transparency.\n\nOn the labelling for blended honeys, for example, all countries of origin are now required to appear near a product\'s name, where previously it was only mandatory to state whether blending had occurred.\n\nLabelling in the UK, which has now left the EU, is not as stringent and

southwest England.\n\nBut the master beekeeper, who has been keeping hives for more than 40 years, has found herself in a fight against a tricky and evolving foe -- honey fraudsters.\n\nThe practice of adulterating honey is well known, and historically adulterants such as ash and potato flour have been used.\n\nNow, advancements in technology and science have made it much easier, with "bespoke, designer or bioengineered" syrups used as diluting agents capable of fooling authenticity tests, Ingram said.\n\nShe founded the UK Honey Authenticity Network (HAN UK) in 2021 to raise awareness about natural honey and warn of the threat posed by fraud.\n\n"One of the impacts we\'re seeing all over the world is beekeepers going out of business," she said.\n\nAdulterated honey can be sold to retailers for a price several times lower than genuine producers can afford.\n\nAs well as producing their own honey, many larger-scale beekeepers have crop pollination contracts with farmers,

protect the industry and consumers.\n\n"I\'d like to see an acknowledgement that there is actually an issue here," she said.\n\nBetter labelling\n\nIn May, the European Union updated its honey regulations to ensure clearer product labelling and a "honey traceability system" to increase transparency.\n\nOn the labelling for blended honeys, for example, all countries of origin are now required to appear near a product\'s name, where previously it was only mandatory to state whether blending had occurred.\n\nLabelling in the UK, which has now left the EU, is not as stringent and Ingram believes consumers are "being misled" by vague packaging.\n\nBehind the EU action is an apparent increase in adulterated honey arriving in the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe substandard adulterates can

My role at AT&T centers around leading a team of engineers who introduce new technologies, and so many of the dynamics of beekeeping are relevant to managing innovation teams.\n\nBees, being pollinators, help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat. Honeybees achieve this through a distinct governance structure in which the queen sets the tone for the characteristics and culture of her hive, but she wisely leans on counsel from an older generation of worker bees—acting as the board of directors that guide the rank and file of the colony.\n\nBeekeeping distills the key tools you need for managing innovation cycles: how to support growth into new levels of scale; shepherding the team’s strengths and development; and the importance of establishing a culture of enthusiasm. But perhaps more unexpected than anything else, you learn not to overly focus on the honey, and instead to keep your primary focus on building the best box for the bees.\n\nThe box is your organization\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 1:\n* Foster a culture of enthusiasm: When bees bring nectar back to the hive, they must sell it to the other bees. The attention their nectar receives depends on the excitement with which they present it. Your team should feel safe to innovate, act boldly, and shout, "I have an idea!" even if it turns out to be wrong. In an incubation environment, there should be no fear of “crying wolf”—only buzzing bees focused on driving innovations that contribute to collective success. This means nurturing a culture where everyone is enthusiastic about their bold ideas, and where smart risks and fast failure are part of a larger strategy aimed at creating long-term value and sustainability. This goes beyond the “fail early” mindset; sometimes, a truly disruptive idea needs extra room to develop. The key is to create an atmosphere where the response is "how could we make this better, if we were doing it again?" rather than causing embarrassment. \nAs with many things in life, focusing too much on the immediate goal (honey) doesn’t optimize long-term success. Instead, healthy architecture and attentive systems-level management are what yield lasting results.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 1:\n* Always have a backup beekeeper: Consistency is key when checking in with your hive. I do it every few weeks. Always have a backup beekeeper (or department head) to ensure steady management, as innovation requires a continuous and steady hand. While the queen leads, the department heads, akin to senior worker bees, are crucial for guidance. When launching a new innovation, these senior workers play pivotal roles in two stages. First, they test your idea, evaluating its potential, economics, supply chain support, infrastructure needs, timing, operational impact, and its ability to change lives. Once the idea passes this evaluation, these leaders are essential in rallying the team and driving the execution of the innovation.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 1:\n* Promote and develop talent: When your talent reaches 80% of mastering their role, you should promote them and have them train someone into their old role. They’ve shown they can be successful in your organization, and you want to make clear that yours is an environment that delivers perennial learnings. Bees naturally want to swarm. That\'s how they grow. But amazingly, once the nectar starts, bees don\'t swarm. That’s because they have a really busy job and are dialed in. \n * Scaffold for success: Better scaffolded bees will find better honey. We know that bees build excess comb in a space larger than 3/8 inch. They’ll also fill any space less than 1/4 inch with propolis (their antifungal hive structural material). So, we keep their “bee spaces” between that 3/8 inch and 1/4 inch. In a company, your innovators need room to refine their role, but they also need clear responsibilities and goals—even if the goals are changeable.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 1:\n* Embrace continuous learning: A bee’s strengths change over time. They excel at making wax until about eight weeks old, then move on to new roles. Bees are adept at learning and can have multiple jobs in their lifetime, ranging from nurse bees and guard bees to foragers. Each role is critical, and bees are promoted through these positions as they age. The lesson? Managers should consider these changing strengths when assigning roles and seek out when employees are ready for a progression.\n* Focus on creating lasting value: Much like focusing on the honey can distract you from thinking long-term about the hive, an overemphasis on current products may hinder disruptive innovations. For instance, solving internet load issues in 1994 led to high-speed internet and the smartphone revolution. Similarly, if we were too focused on the benefits of Wi-Fi alone (the current honey), we would have missed the need for seamless connectivity across Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellite networks. This convergence led to the development of fiber-optic technology, which is now the backbone of high-capacity communication networks. An enterprise mindset is crucial here. We invent the future when we push the boundaries of the present and challenge the status quo. Each individual’s efforts should align with the broader goals of the organization and focus on creating lasting value.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 2:\nLynne Ingram cuts a peaceful figure as she tends to a row of humming beehives in a leafy corner of Somerset, southwest England.\n\nBut the master beekeeper, who has been keeping hives for more than 40 years, has found herself in a fight against a tricky and evolving foe -- honey fraudsters.\n\nThe practice of adulterating honey is well known, and historically adulterants such as ash and potato flour have been used.\n\nNow, advancements in technology and science have made it much easier, with "bespoke, designer or bioengineered" syrups used as diluting agents capable of fooling authenticity tests, Ingram said.\n\nShe founded the UK Honey Authenticity Network (HAN UK) in 2021 to raise awareness about natural honey and warn of the threat posed by fraud.\n\n"One of the impacts we\'re seeing all over the world is beekeepers going out of business," she said.\n\nAdulterated honey can be sold to retailers for a price several times lower than genuine producers can afford.\n\nAs well as producing their own honey, many larger-scale beekeepers have crop pollination contracts with farmers, delivering thousands of colonies to growers across the country.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/05/supermarkets-are-being-infiltrated-with-designer-honey-that-can-cause-diabetes-obesity-and-liver-damage/\n\nSource 2:\nIf they go out of business due to unfair competition, this vital natural method of pollinating crops is reduced and food production suffers.\n\nThe British Beekeepers Association, which represents more than 25,000 producers and where Ingram is a honey ambassador, wants the risk of fraud to be recognised to protect the industry and consumers.\n\n"I\'d like to see an acknowledgement that there is actually an issue here," she said.\n\nBetter labelling\n\nIn May, the European Union updated its honey regulations to ensure clearer product labelling and a "honey traceability system" to increase transparency.\n\nOn the labelling for blended honeys, for example, all countries of origin are now required to appear near a product\'s name, where previously it was only mandatory to state whether blending had occurred.\n\nLabelling in the UK, which has now left the EU, is not as stringent and Ingram believes consumers are "being misled" by vague packaging.\n\nBehind the EU action is an apparent increase in adulterated honey arriving in the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe substandard adulterates can have adverse effects on consumers\' health, such as raising the risk of diabetes, obesity, and liver or kidney damage.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/05/supermarkets-are-being-infiltrated-with-designer-honey-that-can-cause-diabetes-obesity-and-liver-damage/\n\nSource 3:\nDecreasing and endangered populations of honeybees <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-28142-6_8#:~:text=Prolonged%20dry%20climate%20and%20excessive,the%20dearth%20period%20during%20winter> will also have an impact on cosmetics.

My role at AT&T centers around leading a team of engineers who introduce new technologies, and so many of the dynamics of beekeeping are relevant to managing innovation teams.\n\nBees, being pollinators, help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat. Honeybees achieve this through a distinct governance structure in which the queen sets the tone for the characteristics and culture of her hive, but she wisely leans on counsel from an older generation of worker bees—acting as the board of directors that guide the rank and file of the colony.\n\nBeekeeping distills the key tools you need for managing innovation cycles: how to support growth into new levels of scale; shepherding the team’s strengths and development; and the importance of establishing a culture of enthusiasm. But perhaps more unexpected than anything else, you learn not to overly focus on the honey, and instead to keep your primary focus on building the best box for the bees.\n\nThe box is your organization\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 1:\n* Foster a culture of enthusiasm: When bees bring nectar back to the hive, they must sell it to the other bees. The attention their nectar receives depends on the excitement with which they present it. Your team should feel safe to innovate, act boldly, and shout, "I have an idea!" even if it turns out to be wrong. In an incubation environment, there should be no fear of “crying wolf”—only buzzing bees focused on driving innovations that contribute to collective success. This means nurturing a culture where everyone is enthusiastic about their bold ideas, and where smart risks and fast failure are part of a larger strategy aimed at creating long-term value and sustainability. This goes beyond the “fail early” mindset; sometimes, a truly disruptive idea needs extra room to develop. The key is to create an atmosphere where the response is "how could we make this better, if we were doing it again?" rather than causing embarrassment. \nAs with many things in life, focusing too much on the immediate goal (honey) doesn’t optimize long-term success. Instead, healthy architecture and attentive systems-level management are what yield lasting results.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 1:\n* Always have a backup beekeeper: Consistency is key when checking in with your hive. I do it every few weeks. Always have a backup beekeeper (or department head) to ensure steady management, as innovation requires a continuous and steady hand. While the queen leads, the department heads, akin to senior worker bees, are crucial for guidance. When launching a new innovation, these senior workers play pivotal roles in two stages. First, they test your idea, evaluating its potential, economics, supply chain support, infrastructure needs, timing, operational impact, and its ability to change lives. Once the idea passes this evaluation, these leaders are essential in rallying the team and driving the execution of the innovation.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 1:\n* Promote and develop talent: When your talent reaches 80% of mastering their role, you should promote them and have them train someone into their old role. They’ve shown they can be successful in your organization, and you want to make clear that yours is an environment that delivers perennial learnings. Bees naturally want to swarm. That\'s how they grow. But amazingly, once the nectar starts, bees don\'t swarm. That’s because they have a really busy job and are dialed in. \n * Scaffold for success: Better scaffolded bees will find better honey. We know that bees build excess comb in a space larger than 3/8 inch. They’ll also fill any space less than 1/4 inch with propolis (their antifungal hive structural material). So, we keep their “bee spaces” between that 3/8 inch and 1/4 inch. In a company, your innovators need room to refine their role, but they also need clear responsibilities and goals—even if the goals are changeable.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 1:\n* Embrace continuous learning: A bee’s strengths change over time. They excel at making wax until about eight weeks old, then move on to new roles. Bees are adept at learning and can have multiple jobs in their lifetime, ranging from nurse bees and guard bees to foragers. Each role is critical, and bees are promoted through these positions as they age. The lesson? Managers should consider these changing strengths when assigning roles and seek out when employees are ready for a progression.\n* Focus on creating lasting value: Much like focusing on the honey can distract you from thinking long-term about the hive, an overemphasis on current products may hinder disruptive innovations. For instance, solving internet load issues in 1994 led to high-speed internet and the smartphone revolution. Similarly, if we were too focused on the benefits of Wi-Fi alone (the current honey), we would have missed the need for seamless connectivity across Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellite networks. This convergence led to the development of fiber-optic technology, which is now the backbone of high-capacity communication networks. An enterprise mindset is crucial here. We invent the future when we push the boundaries of the present and challenge the status quo. Each individual’s efforts should align with the broader goals of the organization and focus on creating lasting value.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 2:\nLynne Ingram cuts a peaceful figure as she tends to a row of humming beehives in a leafy corner of Somerset, southwest England.\n\nBut the master beekeeper, who has been keeping hives for more than 40 years, has found herself in a fight against a tricky and evolving foe -- honey fraudsters.\n\nThe practice of adulterating honey is well known, and historically adulterants such as ash and potato flour have been used.\n\nNow, advancements in technology and science have made it much easier, with "bespoke, designer or bioengineered" syrups used as diluting agents capable of fooling authenticity tests, Ingram said.\n\nShe founded the UK Honey Authenticity Network (HAN UK) in 2021 to raise awareness about natural honey and warn of the threat posed by fraud.\n\n"One of the impacts we\'re seeing all over the world is beekeepers going out of business," she said.\n\nAdulterated honey can be sold to retailers for a price several times lower than genuine producers can afford.\n\nAs well as producing their own honey, many larger-scale beekeepers have crop pollination contracts with farmers, delivering thousands of colonies to growers across the country.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/05/supermarkets-are-being-infiltrated-with-designer-honey-that-can-cause-diabetes-obesity-and-liver-damage/\n\nSource 2:\nIf they go out of business due to unfair competition, this vital natural method of pollinating crops is reduced and food production suffers.\n\nThe British Beekeepers Association, which represents more than 25,000 producers and where Ingram is a honey ambassador, wants the risk of fraud to be recognised to protect the industry and consumers.\n\n"I\'d like to see an acknowledgement that there is actually an issue here," she said.\n\nBetter labelling\n\nIn May, the European Union updated its honey regulations to ensure clearer product labelling and a "honey traceability system" to increase transparency.\n\nOn the labelling for blended honeys, for example, all countries of origin are now required to appear near a product\'s name, where previously it was only mandatory to state whether blending had occurred.\n\nLabelling in the UK, which has now left the EU, is not as stringent and Ingram believes consumers are "being misled" by vague packaging.\n\nBehind the EU action is an apparent increase in adulterated honey arriving in the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe substandard adulterates can have adverse effects on consumers\' health, such as raising the risk of diabetes, obesity, and liver or kidney damage.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/05/supermarkets-are-being-infiltrated-with-designer-honey-that-can-cause-diabetes-obesity-and-liver-damage/\n\nSource 3:\nDecreasing and endangered populations of honeybees <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-28142-6_8#:~:text=Prolonged%20dry%20climate%20and%20excessive,the%20dearth%20period%20during%20winter> will also have an impact on cosmetics.

My role at AT&T centers around leading a team of engineers who introduce new technologies, and so many of the dynamics of beekeeping are relevant to managing innovation teams.\n\nBees, being pollinators, help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat. Honeybees achieve this through a distinct governance structure in which the queen sets the tone for the characteristics and culture of her hive, but she wisely leans on counsel from an older generation of worker bees—acting as the board of directors that guide the rank and file of the colony.\n\nBeekeeping distills the key tools you need for managing innovation cycles: how to support growth into new levels of scale; shepherding the team’s strengths and development; and the importance of establishing a culture of enthusiasm. But perhaps more unexpected than anything else, you learn not to overly focus on the honey, and instead to keep your primary focus on building the best box for the bees.\n\nThe box is your organization\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 1:\n* Foster a culture of enthusiasm: When bees bring nectar back to the hive, they must sell it to the other bees. The attention their nectar receives depends on the excitement with which they present it. Your team should feel safe to innovate, act boldly, and shout, "I have an idea!" even if it turns out to be wrong. In an incubation environment, there should be no fear of “crying wolf”—only buzzing bees focused on driving innovations that contribute to collective success. This means nurturing a culture where everyone is enthusiastic about their bold ideas, and where smart risks and fast failure are part of a larger strategy aimed at creating long-term value and sustainability. This goes beyond the “fail early” mindset; sometimes, a truly disruptive idea needs extra room to develop. The key is to create an atmosphere where the response is "how could we make this better, if we were doing it again?" rather than causing embarrassment. \nAs with many things in life, focusing too much on the immediate goal (honey) doesn’t optimize long-term success. Instead, healthy architecture and attentive systems-level management are what yield lasting results.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 1:\n* Always have a backup beekeeper: Consistency is key when checking in with your hive. I do it every few weeks. Always have a backup beekeeper (or department head) to ensure steady management, as innovation requires a continuous and steady hand. While the queen leads, the department heads, akin to senior worker bees, are crucial for guidance. When launching a new innovation, these senior workers play pivotal roles in two stages. First, they test your idea, evaluating its potential, economics, supply chain support, infrastructure needs, timing, operational impact, and its ability to change lives. Once the idea passes this evaluation, these leaders are essential in rallying the team and driving the execution of the innovation.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 1:\n* Promote and develop talent: When your talent reaches 80% of mastering their role, you should promote them and have them train someone into their old role. They’ve shown they can be successful in your organization, and you want to make clear that yours is an environment that delivers perennial learnings. Bees naturally want to swarm. That\'s how they grow. But amazingly, once the nectar starts, bees don\'t swarm. That’s because they have a really busy job and are dialed in. \n * Scaffold for success: Better scaffolded bees will find better honey. We know that bees build excess comb in a space larger than 3/8 inch. They’ll also fill any space less than 1/4 inch with propolis (their antifungal hive structural material). So, we keep their “bee spaces” between that 3/8 inch and 1/4 inch. In a company, your innovators need room to refine their role, but they also need clear responsibilities and goals—even if the goals are changeable.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 1:\n* Embrace continuous learning: A bee’s strengths change over time. They excel at making wax until about eight weeks old, then move on to new roles. Bees are adept at learning and can have multiple jobs in their lifetime, ranging from nurse bees and guard bees to foragers. Each role is critical, and bees are promoted through these positions as they age. The lesson? Managers should consider these changing strengths when assigning roles and seek out when employees are ready for a progression.\n* Focus on creating lasting value: Much like focusing on the honey can distract you from thinking long-term about the hive, an overemphasis on current products may hinder disruptive innovations. For instance, solving internet load issues in 1994 led to high-speed internet and the smartphone revolution. Similarly, if we were too focused on the benefits of Wi-Fi alone (the current honey), we would have missed the need for seamless connectivity across Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellite networks. This convergence led to the development of fiber-optic technology, which is now the backbone of high-capacity communication networks. An enterprise mindset is crucial here. We invent the future when we push the boundaries of the present and challenge the status quo. Each individual’s efforts should align with the broader goals of the organization and focus on creating lasting value.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/08/leadership-lessons-fortune-500-ceos-beekeeping-mangement/\n\nSource 2:\nLynne Ingram cuts a peaceful figure as she tends to a row of humming beehives in a leafy corner of Somerset, southwest England.\n\nBut the master beekeeper, who has been keeping hives for more than 40 years, has found herself in a fight against a tricky and evolving foe -- honey fraudsters.\n\nThe practice of adulterating honey is well known, and historically adulterants such as ash and potato flour have been used.\n\nNow, advancements in technology and science have made it much easier, with "bespoke, designer or bioengineered" syrups used as diluting agents capable of fooling authenticity tests, Ingram said.\n\nShe founded the UK Honey Authenticity Network (HAN UK) in 2021 to raise awareness about natural honey and warn of the threat posed by fraud.\n\n"One of the impacts we\'re seeing all over the world is beekeepers going out of business," she said.\n\nAdulterated honey can be sold to retailers for a price several times lower than genuine producers can afford.\n\nAs well as producing their own honey, many larger-scale beekeepers have crop pollination contracts with farmers, delivering thousands of colonies to growers across the country.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/05/supermarkets-are-being-infiltrated-with-designer-honey-that-can-cause-diabetes-obesity-and-liver-damage/\n\nSource 2:\nIf they go out of business due to unfair competition, this vital natural method of pollinating crops is reduced and food production suffers.\n\nThe British Beekeepers Association, which represents more than 25,000 producers and where Ingram is a honey ambassador, wants the risk of fraud to be recognised to protect the industry and consumers.\n\n"I\'d like to see an acknowledgement that there is actually an issue here," she said.\n\nBetter labelling\n\nIn May, the European Union updated its honey regulations to ensure clearer product labelling and a "honey traceability system" to increase transparency.\n\nOn the labelling for blended honeys, for example, all countries of origin are now required to appear near a product\'s name, where previously it was only mandatory to state whether blending had occurred.\n\nLabelling in the UK, which has now left the EU, is not as stringent and Ingram believes consumers are "being misled" by vague packaging.\n\nBehind the EU action is an apparent increase in adulterated honey arriving in the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe substandard adulterates can have adverse effects on consumers\' health, such as raising the risk of diabetes, obesity, and liver or kidney damage.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/05/supermarkets-are-being-infiltrated-with-designer-honey-that-can-cause-diabetes-obesity-and-liver-damage/\n\nSource 3:\nDecreasing and endangered populations of honeybees <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-28142-6_8#:~:text=Prolonged%20dry%20climate%20and%20excessive,the%20dearth%20period%20during%20winter> will also have an impact on cosmetics.

If there\'s only one stinging insect around, they recommend staying calm and still, and to avoid swatting at it. But if several are stinging, they say it\'s better to try to quickly get indoors or into a shaded area.

The state is planning to allow people to buy epinephrine injections such as EpiPens without a prescription, and it is working to collect and distribute donations of medicines.\n\nWhile most people are not allergic to stings from bees and other insects, irritation and pain can be intense and stings can swell and remain painful for days, according to the Mayo Clinic <https://fortune.com/company/mayo-clinic/>. And some people can have a severe allergic reaction that can lead to anaphylaxis that can cause difficulty breathing, swelling of the tongue and throat, weak pulse and loss of consciousness. In these situations, it\'s critical to administer epinephrine immediately.\n\nBeing stung more than a dozen times can also cause a buildup of venom in the body that can cause serious sickness that can include dizziness, fever, convulsions or vomiting.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/04/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-epi-pens/\n\nSource 5:\nMeta’s plans for an AI data center were disrupted by an unusual culprit—rare bees. \n\nThe tech giant helmed by Mark Zuckerberg was in the process of hammering out a deal with the operator of a nuclear power plant that would have provided electricity for a new data center.

2024-11-08 12:02:52,954: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Bees are crucial to ecosystems because they play a vital role in pollination. As pollinators, bees help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat [1]. Without bees, many plants would be unable to reproduce, and the variety of food available to humans would be severely limited. In addition to their role in food production, bees also pollinate flowers and other plants, which is essential for maintaining the health and diversity of ecosystems.

Bees are also important indicators of ecosystem health. Changes

2024-11-08 12:02:53,268: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Bees are crucial to ecosystems because they play a vital role in pollination. As pollinators, bees help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat [1]. Without bees, many plants would be unable to reproduce, and the variety of food available to humans would be severely limited. In addition to their role in food production, bees also pollinate flowers and other plants, which is essential for maintaining the health and diversity of ecosystems.

Bees are also important indicators of ecosystem health. Changes in bee populations can signal broader environmental issues, such as the impact of climate change, pesticide use, and habitat destruction [3]. For example

2024-11-08 12:02:53,523: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Bees are crucial to ecosystems because they play a vital role in pollination. As pollinators, bees help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat [1]. Without bees, many plants would be unable to reproduce, and the variety of food available to humans would be severely limited. In addition to their role in food production, bees also pollinate flowers and other plants, which is essential for maintaining the health and diversity of ecosystems.

Bees are also important indicators of ecosystem health. Changes in bee populations can signal broader environmental issues, such as the impact of climate change, pesticide use, and habitat destruction [3]. For example, decreasing and endangered populations of honeybees will have an impact on cosmetics, as honey and bees

2024-11-08 12:02:53,755: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Bees are crucial to ecosystems because they play a vital role in pollination. As pollinators, bees help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat [1]. Without bees, many plants would be unable to reproduce, and the variety of food available to humans would be severely limited. In addition to their role in food production, bees also pollinate flowers and other plants, which is essential for maintaining the health and diversity of ecosystems.

Bees are also important indicators of ecosystem health. Changes in bee populations can signal broader environmental issues, such as the impact of climate change, pesticide use, and habitat destruction [3].

2024-11-08 12:02:54,003: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Bees are crucial to ecosystems because they play a vital role in pollination. As pollinators, bees help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat [1]. Without bees, many plants would be unable to reproduce, and the variety of food available to humans would be severely limited. In addition to their role in food production, bees also pollinate flowers and other plants, which is essential for maintaining the health and diversity of ecosystems.

Bees are also important indicators of ecosystem health. Changes in bee populations can signal broader environmental issues, such as the impact of climate change, pesticide use, and habitat destruction [3]. For example, decreasing and endangered populations of honeybees will have an impact on cosmetics, as honey and beeswax are increasingly being used in products from lip balms to face masks [3]. Furthermore, the loss of bees could have significant economic and social implications, particularly for rural communities

As pollinators, bees help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat [1]. Without bees, many plants would be unable to reproduce, and the variety of food available to humans would be severely limited. In addition to their role in food production, bees also pollinate flowers and other plants, which is essential for maintaining the health and diversity of ecosystems.

Bees are also important indicators of ecosystem health. Changes in bee populations can signal broader environmental issues, such as the impact of climate change, pesticide use, and habitat destruction [3]. For example, decreasing and endangered populations of honeybees will have an impact on cosmetics, as honey and beeswax are increasingly being used in products from lip balms to face masks [3]. Furthermore, the loss of bees could have significant economic and social implications, particularly for rural communities that rely on beekeeping and pollination services.

2024-11-08 12:02:54,507: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Bees are crucial to ecosystems because they play a vital role in pollination. As pollinators, bees help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat [1]. Without bees, many plants would be unable to reproduce, and the variety of food available to humans would be severely limited. In addition to their role in food production, bees also pollinate flowers and other plants, which is essential for maintaining the health and diversity of ecosystems.

Bees are also important indicators of ecosystem health. Changes in bee populations can signal broader environmental issues, such as the impact of climate change, pesticide use, and habitat destruction [3]. For example, decreasing and endangered populations of honeybees will have an impact on cosmetics, as honey and beeswax are increasingly being used in products from lip balms to face masks [3]. Furthermore, the loss of bees could have significant economic and social implications, particularly for rural communities that rely on beekeeping and pollination services.

The importance of bees to ecosystems is also reflected in the consequences of their decline. If beekeepers go out of business due to unfair competition from adulter

For example, decreasing and endangered populations of honeybees will have an impact on cosmetics, as honey and beeswax are increasingly being used in products from lip balms to face masks [3]. Furthermore, the loss of bees could have significant economic and social implications, particularly for rural communities that rely on beekeeping and pollination services.

The importance of bees to ecosystems is also reflected in the consequences of their decline. If beekeepers go out of business due to unfair competition from adulterated honey, the vital natural method of pollinating crops is reduced, and food production suffers [2].

As pollinators, bees help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat [1].

In addition to their role in food production, bees also pollinate flowers and other plants, which is essential for maintaining the health and diversity of ecosystems.

For example, decreasing and endangered populations of honeybees will have an impact on cosmetics, as honey and beeswax are increasingly being used in products from lip balms to face masks [3]. Furthermore, the loss of bees could have significant economic and social implications, particularly for rural communities that rely on beekeeping and pollination services.

The importance of bees to ecosystems is also reflected in the consequences of their decline. If beekeepers go out of business due to unfair competition from adulterated honey, the vital natural method of pollinating crops is reduced, and food production suffers [2]. This highlights the need to protect bee populations and the ecosystem services

Furthermore, the loss of bees could have significant economic and social implications, particularly for rural communities that rely on beekeeping and pollination services.

The importance of bees to ecosystems is also reflected in the consequences of their decline. If beekeepers go out of business due to unfair competition from adulterated honey, the vital natural method of pollinating crops is reduced, and food production suffers [2]. This highlights the need to protect bee populations and the ecosystem services they provide. By supporting sustainable beekeeping practices and reducing the risk of honey fraud, we

2024-11-08 12:02:55,398: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Bees are crucial to ecosystems because they play a vital role in pollination. As pollinators, bees help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat [1]. Without bees, many plants would be unable to reproduce, and the variety of food available to humans would be severely limited. In addition to their role in food production, bees also pollinate flowers and other plants, which is essential for maintaining the health and diversity of ecosystems.

Bees are also important indicators of ecosystem health. Changes in bee populations can signal broader environmental issues, such as the impact of climate change, pesticide use, and habitat destruction [3]. For example, decreasing and endangered populations of honeybees will have an impact on cosmetics, as honey and beeswax are increasingly being used in products from lip balms to face masks [3]. Furthermore, the loss of bees could have significant economic and social implications, particularly for rural communities that rely on beekeeping and pollination services.

The importance of bees to ecosystems is also reflected in the consequences of their decline. If beekeepers go out of business due to unfair competition from adulterated honey, the vital natural method of pollinating crops is reduced, and food production suffers [2]. This highlights the need to protect bee populations and the ecosystem services they provide. By supporting sustainable beekeeping practices and reducing the risk of honey fraud, we can help maintain the health of ecosystems and ensure the long-term viability of

2024-11-08 12:02:55,491: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why are bees important to ecosystems?

2024-11-08 12:02:55,491: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Bees are crucial to ecosystems because they play a vital role in pollination. As pollinators, bees help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat [1]. Without bees, many plants would be unable to reproduce, and the variety of food available to humans would be severely limited. In addition to their role in food production, bees also pollinate flowers and other plants, which is essential for maintaining the health and diversity of ecosystems.

Bees are also important indicators of ecosystem health. Changes in bee populations can signal broader environmental issues, such as the impact of climate change, pesticide use, and habitat destruction [3]. For example, decreasing and endangered populations of honeybees will have an impact on cosmetics, as honey and beeswax are increasingly being used in products from lip balms to face masks [3]. Furthermore, the loss of bees could have significant economic and social implications, particularly for rural communities that rely on beekeeping and pollination services.

The importance of bees to ecosystems is also reflected in the consequences of their decline. If beekeepers go out of business due to unfair competition from adulterated honey, the vital natural method of pollinating crops is reduced, and food production suffers [2]. This highlights the need to protect bee populations and the ecosystem services they provide. By supporting sustainable beekeeping practices and reducing the risk of honey fraud, we can help maintain the health of ecosystems and ensure the long-term viability of food production [2].
