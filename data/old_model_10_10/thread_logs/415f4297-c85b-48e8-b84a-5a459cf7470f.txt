Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer <https://apnews.com/article/labor-travel-weekend-travel-forecast-afb55b5995f4486cd3982aadff9a9992>.\n\nAAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 38 million of them taking vehicles.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/25/memorial-day-weekend-airport-passengers-new-record-summer-travel-season-forecast/\n\nSource 7:\n“The airlines are not always the good guys, so I don\'t want to make it sound like that,” he said. “But at the same time, it\'s not the most profitable business in the world.”\n\nDespite record travel numbers, airlines have yet to see more travelers translate to more profit. Boeing <https://fortune.com/company/boeing/> aircraft delivery delays, inflation, labor shortages, and poor expansion strategies have all dented <https://www.businessinsider.com/why-airlines-are-struggling-despite-record-travel-demand-profits-revenue-2024-6> the industry’s bottom line. The bleak outlook of the industry has Henderson concerned about TikTok trends and sharing hacks that may lead too many travelers to take advantage of overbooking rules.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/07/us-airline-travel-free-overbooked-flights/\n\nSource 8:\nBoeing’s trajectory from here towers as one of the most significant business dramas of this millennium. U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, over one-quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers. Boeing produced around 40% of the 29,000 commercial aircraft filling the skies worldwide. This is the company that launched the jet age; created the world’s first wide-body in its fabled 747; ranks as America’s third biggest defense contractor behind Lockheed Martin <https://fortune.com/company/lockheed-martin/> and RTX <https://fortune.com/company/raytheon-technologies/>, and has long reigned as America’s largest exporter. But Boeing is stumbling just when it should be capitalizing on the boom.\nPORTLAND, OREGON - JANUARY 7: In this National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) handout, an opening is seen in the fuselage of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 Boeing 737-9 MAX on January 7, 2024 in Portland, Oregon. A door-sized section near the rear of the Boeing 737-9 MAX plane blew off 10 minutes after Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 took off from Portland, Oregon on January 5 on its way to Ontario, California.

However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4].

2024-11-08 12:06:08,613: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Unfortunately, I don't have information on the largest airline by fleet size. However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried.

However, I couldn't find any information that directly answers which airline is the largest by fleet size or the number of passengers carried. But I can tell you that Ryanair has a fleet of 584 aircraft, many of them fuel-efficient Boeing 737 "Gamechangers," substantially

2024-11-08 12:06:09,103: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Unfortunately, I don't have information on the largest airline by fleet size. However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried.

However, I couldn't find any information that directly answers which airline is the largest by fleet size or the number of passengers carried.

2024-11-08 12:06:09,347: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Unfortunately, I don't have information on the largest airline by fleet size. However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried.

However, I couldn't find any information that directly answers which airline is the largest by fleet size or the number of passengers carried. But I can tell you that Ryanair has a fleet of 584 aircraft, many of them fuel-efficient Boeing 737 "Gamechangers," substantially above the 475 in its fleet in 2019 [5]. This makes Ryanair one of the larger airlines in terms of fleet size, but I couldn't find any information that confirms it as the largest.

2024-11-08 12:06:10,002: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Which airline is the largest by fleet size and number of passengers carried?

2024-11-08 12:06:10,002: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Unfortunately, I don't have information on the largest airline by fleet size. However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried.

However, I couldn't find any information that directly answers which airline is the largest by fleet size or the number of passengers carried. But I can tell you that Ryanair has a fleet of 584 aircraft, many of them fuel-efficient Boeing 737 "Gamechangers," substantially above the 475 in its fleet in 2019 [5]. This makes Ryanair one of the larger airlines in terms of fleet size, but I couldn't find any information that confirms it as the largest.

It's also worth noting that the airline industry is highly competitive, and different airlines may have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, Singapore Airlines reported its best ever financial performance with $1.9 billion in net profits from $14.1 billion in revenues for its fiscal 2024 [3].

2024-11-08 12:06:10,172: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Which airline is the largest by fleet size and number of passengers carried?

2024-11-08 12:06:10,172: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Unfortunately, I don't have information on the largest airline by fleet size. However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried.

However, I couldn't find any information that directly answers which airline is the largest by fleet size or the number of passengers carried. But I can tell you that Ryanair has a fleet of 584 aircraft, many of them fuel-efficient Boeing 737 "Gamechangers," substantially above the 475 in its fleet in 2019 [5]. This makes Ryanair one of the larger airlines in terms of fleet size, but I couldn't find any information that confirms it as the largest.

It's also worth noting that the airline industry is highly competitive, and different airlines may have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, Singapore Airlines reported its best ever financial performance with $1.9 billion in net profits from $14.1 billion in revenues for its fiscal 2024 [3]. However, this information doesn't provide insight into the airline's fleet size or the number of passengers carried.
