MacArthur Foundation announced Tuesday its 2024 class of fellows, often known as recipients of the “genius grant."\n\nThe 22 fellows will each receive a grant of $800,000 over five years to spend however they want. They were selected from nominations in a yearslong process that solicits input from their communities and peers. Fellows do not apply and are never officially informed that they’ve been nominated unless they are selected for the award.\n\nThe interdisciplinary award seeks to “enable” people with a track record and the potential to produce additional extraordinary work, said Marlies Carruth, director of the MacArthur Fellows Program.\n\nThe 2024 fellows are:\n\nLoka Ashwood, 39, Lexington, Kentucky, a sociologist at the University of Kentucky who studies how environmental issues, corporations and state policy intersect to harm rural communities and reduce their trust in democracy.\n\nRuha Benjamin, 46, Princeton, New Jersey, a transdisciplinary scholar and writer at Princeton University who studies how new technologies and medical research often reinforce social and racial inequality and bias.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.60638607), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='68916c12-ce3e-4d1b-8e01-3bf88ce3deed', embedding=None, metadata={'id': '3f11e70cf0ca26b9f91eb1903b54a422c06d688188e496a4dd05cf8bb6f52453-0', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': '3f11e70cf0ca26b9f91eb1903b54a422c06d688188e496a4dd05cf8bb6f52453', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20241008, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-08', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1260047116-e1728389365383.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2024, 'date_month': 10, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/2024/10/08/ai-pioneers-geoffrey-hinton-and-john-hopfield-win-nobel-prize-for-physics/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 8, 'title': 'AI pioneers Geoffrey Hinton and John Hopfield win Nobel Prize for physics', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/2024/10/08/ai-pioneers-geoffrey-hinton-and-john-hopfield-win-nobel-prize-for-physics/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='For the first time, a Nobel Prize has been awarded to pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nGeoffrey Hinton and John Hopfield were on Tuesday granted the honor of becoming Nobel laureates in physics, for their work on artificial neural networks over the last four decades.

A corollary of this idea was that it would be possible to manipulate DNA to design proteins, which are the building blocks and engines of life, with specific functions, since it is mostly a protein’s shape that determines what it does.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/nobel-win-for-google-deepmind-cofounder-shows-progress-towards-vision-of-ai-scientists/\n\nSource 5:\nI enjoy reading a wide range of books. I recently read “Churchill: Walking with Destiny” by Andrew Roberts and “Elon Musk” by Walter Isaacson. I have also enjoyed several books on artificial intelligence and quantum computing, including “Quantum Supremacy” by Michio Kaku. Some of the classics I particularly like include: “The Sun Also Rises” and “The Old Man and the Sea” – both by Ernest Hemingway; “Silas Marner” by George Eliot, and of course, Harper Lee’s “To Kill a Mockingbird”, which inspired me to go to law school. As it can be difficult to find time to read longer novels, I have also enjoyed reading short stories, like: “Master and Man” by Leo Tolstoy; “Gooseberries” by Anton Chekhov. Lately, I have been exploring books on soil health and regenerative agriculture; one of the first being “Dirt to Soil” by Gabe Brown.\nNorman Borlaug , 1970 Nobel Peace Prize.

Some of the classics I particularly like include: “The Sun Also Rises” and “The Old Man and the Sea” – both by Ernest Hemingway; “Silas Marner” by George Eliot, and of course, Harper Lee’s “To Kill a Mockingbird”, which inspired me to go to law school. As it can be difficult to find time to read longer novels, I have also enjoyed reading short stories, like: “Master and Man” by Leo Tolstoy; “Gooseberries” by Anton Chekhov.

Previously, computer software was much less accurate at predicting protein structures, while imaging methods to discover the shape of proteins were time-consuming and costly.\n\nThis breakthrough was hugely impactful since proteins are the engines behind most biological processes, with their shape determining their function. Among other things, being able to predict the shape of a protein unlocks better understanding of disease and could enable researchers to more quickly develop new drugs.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/google-deepmind-leaders-hassabis-and-jumper-win-nobel-prize-for-chemistry/\n\nSource 8:\nOften called one of the godfathers of artificial intelligence, Hinton praised the work of his peers Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun before making repeated self-deprecating remarks. These included admitting that as a young student he left the study of physics—the field in which he was recognized by the Nobel committee—since he couldn’t handle the math.\n\nThe news of Hinton’s award comes weeks away from the first anniversary of Altman’s brief, stunning, and ultimately unsuccessful ouster—as well as the second anniversary of the launch of ChatGPT at the end of November 2022.\n\nOpenAI’s generative AI chatbot sparked a wave of interest in the technology, as the broader public began to realize for the first time that machines might surpass mankind in intellect this generation.\n\n“Quite a few good researchers believe that sometime in the next 20 years AI will become more intelligent than us, and we need to think hard about what happens then,” Hinton said on Tuesday.\n\nConcerns over the safety of artificial intelligence\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/openai-sam-altman-geoffrey-hinton-nobel-prize-physics-ilya-sutskever-toronto/\n\nSource 9:\nFrom facing jail time to leading the country\n\nIt’s a remarkable turn of events for Yunus, who was facing a jail sentence <https://fortune.com/asia/2024/01/03/nobel-winner-muhammad-yunus-six-month-jail-term-bangladesh-election-sheikh-hasina/> earlier this year. \n\nIn January, a judge in Dhaka convicted Yunus and three other executives at Grameen Telecom for several labor law violations, including failing to create a welfare fund for employees, and he was sentenced to six months in jail. \n\nYet observers believed the case to be politically motivated. Yunus was considered a rival to Hasina, and had briefly flirted with the idea of setting up a rival political party. World leaders like former U.S. president Barack Obama and former UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon called on Bangladesh to suspend <https://apnews.com/article/hasina-yunus-nobel-letter-bangladesh-4b7ee08200cda7fddd6caa364e61274e> the legal proceedings, to no avail.\n\nAt the time, Yunus said the verdict was “contrary to all legal precedent and logic.”\n\nA microfinance pioneer\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/08/07/nobel-laureate-microfinance-pioneer-muhaamad-yunus-interim-leader-bangladesh-protest-crisis/'}
