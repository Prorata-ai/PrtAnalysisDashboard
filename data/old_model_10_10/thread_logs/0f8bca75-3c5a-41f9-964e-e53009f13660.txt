The bleak outlook of the industry has Henderson concerned about TikTok trends and sharing hacks that may lead too many travelers to take advantage of overbooking rules.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/07/us-airline-travel-free-overbooked-flights/\n\nSource 8:\nBoeing’s trajectory from here towers as one of the most significant business dramas of this millennium. U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, over one-quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers. Boeing produced around 40% of the 29,000 commercial aircraft filling the skies worldwide. This is the company that launched the jet age; created the world’s first wide-body in its fabled 747; ranks as America’s third biggest defense contractor behind Lockheed Martin <https://fortune.com/company/lockheed-martin/> and RTX <https://fortune.com/company/raytheon-technologies/>, and has long reigned as America’s largest exporter. But Boeing is stumbling just when it should be capitalizing on the boom.\nPORTLAND, OREGON - JANUARY 7: In this National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) handout, an opening is seen in the fuselage of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 Boeing 737-9 MAX on January 7, 2024 in Portland, Oregon.

However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried.

However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried.

However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried.

However, I do have information on Ryanair's fleet size, which is 584 aircraft, many of them fuel-efficient Boeing 737 "Gamechangers" [5]. This is substantially above the 475 aircraft in its fleet in 2019. In comparison, EasyJet had a fleet of 343 aircraft by the end of March, only marginally above the 331 aircraft it had in 2019 [5].

However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried.

However, I do have information on Ryanair's fleet size, which is 584 aircraft, many of them fuel-efficient Boeing 737 "Gamechangers" [5]. This is substantially above the 475 aircraft in its fleet in 2019. In comparison, EasyJet had a fleet of 343 aircraft by the end of March, only marginally above the 331 aircraft it had in 2019 [5]. While this information does not tell us which airline is the largest by fleet size, it does give us an idea of the fleet sizes

2024-11-08 12:03:39,616: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Which airline is the largest by fleet size and number of passengers carried?

2024-11-08 12:03:39,616: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Unfortunately, I don't have information on the largest airline by fleet size. However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried.

However, I do have information on Ryanair's fleet size, which is 584 aircraft, many of them fuel-efficient Boeing 737 "Gamechangers" [5]. This is substantially above the 475 aircraft in its fleet in 2019. In comparison, EasyJet had a fleet of 343 aircraft by the end of March, only marginally above the 331 aircraft it had in 2019 [5]. While this information does not tell us which airline is the largest by fleet size, it does give us an idea of the fleet sizes of two major European airlines.

It's worth noting that the airline industry is highly competitive, and airlines are constantly evolving to meet changing demand and market conditions. The largest airline by fleet size and number of passengers carried may change from year to year, depending on various factors such as market trends

2024-11-08 12:03:39,802: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Unfortunately, I don't have information on the largest airline by fleet size. However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried.

However, I do have information on Ryanair's fleet size, which is 584 aircraft, many of them fuel-efficient Boeing 737 "Gamechangers" [5]. This is substantially above the 475 aircraft in its fleet in 2019. In comparison, EasyJet had a fleet of 343 aircraft by the end of March, only marginally above the 331 aircraft it had in 2019 [5]. While this information does not tell us which airline is the largest by fleet size, it does give us an idea of the fleet sizes of two major European airlines.

It's worth noting that the airline industry is highly competitive, and airlines are constantly evolving to meet changing demand and market conditions. The largest airline by fleet size and number of passengers carried may change from year to year, depending on various factors such as market trends, airline consolidation, and changes in consumer behavior [2

2024-11-08 12:03:39,866: ObserveEventsHandler(  207): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd response: assistant: Unfortunately, I don't have information on the largest airline by fleet size. However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried.

However, I do have information on Ryanair's fleet size, which is 584 aircraft, many of them fuel-efficient Boeing 737 "Gamechangers" [5]. This is substantially above the 475 aircraft in its fleet in 2019. In comparison, EasyJet had a fleet of 343 aircraft by the end of March, only marginally above the 331 aircraft it had in 2019 [5]. While this information does not tell us which airline is the largest by fleet size, it does give us an idea of the fleet sizes of two major European airlines.

It's worth noting that the airline industry is highly competitive, and airlines are constantly evolving to meet changing demand and market conditions. The largest airline by fleet size and number of passengers carried may change from year to year, depending on various factors such as market trends, airline consolidation, and changes in consumer behavior [2].
