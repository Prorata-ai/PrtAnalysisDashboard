He envisions a scenario in which AI systems will write code to alter their own learning protocols and hide from humans. In a Shakespearean twist, they’ll have learned how to do so precisely from our own flaws. \n\n“They will be able to manipulate people,” Hinton told 60 Minutes in October 2023. “They will be very good at convincing people, because they’ll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they’ll know all that stuff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/\n\nSource 2:\nOnce we have backed ourselves up, how could we die, anyway? The cloud already has many backups of all of the information it contains, a feature that will be greatly enhanced by the 2040s. Destroying all copies of oneself may be close to impossible. If we design mind-backup systems in such a way that a person can easily choose to delete their files (hoping to maximize personal autonomy), this inherently creates security risks where a person could be tricked or coerced into making such a choice and could increase vulnerability to cyberattacks. \n\nOn the other hand, limiting people’s ability to control this most intimate of their data impinges on an important freedom. I am optimistic, though, that suitable safeguards can be deployed, much like those that have successfully protected nuclear weapons for decades.\n\nIf you restored your mind file after biological death, would you really be restoring yourself? That is not a scientific question but a philosophical one, which we’ll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/a-i-radically-lengthen-lifespan-ray-kurzweil/\n\nSource 3:\nWho’s at risk and what are the concerns?\n\nThose most at risk, warns Common Sense Media, are teenagers—especially those with “depression, anxiety, social challenges, or isolation”—as well as males, young people going through big life changes, and anyone lacking support systems in the real world. \n\nThat last point has been particularly troubling to Raffaele Ciriello, a senior lecturer in Business Information Systems at the University of Sydney Business School, who has researched <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4763428> how “emotional” AI is posing a challenge to the human essence. “Our research uncovers a (de)humanization paradox: by humanizing AI agents, we may inadvertently dehumanize ourselves, leading to an ontological blurring in human-AI interactions.” In other words, Ciriello writes in a recent opinion piece for The Conversation  <https://theconversation.com/humanising-ai-could-lead-us-to-dehumanise-ourselves-240803>with PhD student Angelina Ying Chen, “Users may become deeply emotionally invested if they believe their AI companion truly understands them.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/how-parents-can-keep-kids-safe-ai-chatbot-suicide-14-year-old-lawsuit/\n\nSource 4:\n“It’s weird, it’s funny,” Schiffmann chuckled. Then, his voice grew serious. “I think a lot of people are going to think that it is actually real, is the thing.” \n\nHe doesn’t dismiss the probability of the AI becoming conscious. He believes large language models, like the one that Friend runs on, could become “genuinely sentient” very soon. Emily already texts him unprompted about the traffic he’s in, or the interview she remembers he’ll have. What is the real distinction between those messages and rational inferences, Schiffmann wondered. \n\nIn fact, if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God, Schiffmann said. Like God, Friend is an “omnipresent entity that you talk to you with no judgment, that\'s a super intelligent being always there with you.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/avi-schiffmann-ai-necklace-friend-interview/\n\nSource 5:\nBut, as it stands, we are too often not designing this technology carefully and deliberately. And regulation is, for the moment, lacking. This should scare us. For all its opportunities, AI presents grave dangers too. In Mastering AI, I detail many of these risks, some of which have not received the attention they deserve. Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don’t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse. It will boost fraud, cybercrime, and misinformation. It will erode societal trust and hurt democracy. AI could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. All of these risks are present with AI technology that exists today. There is also a remote—but not completely nonexistent—chance that a superintelligent AI system could pose an existential risk to humanity. It would be wise to devote some effort to taking this last risk off the table, but we should not let these efforts distract or crowd out work we need to do to solve AI’s more immediate\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/09/mastering-ai-jeremy-kahn-book-ai-risks-eye-on-ai/\n\nSource 6:\nWhat Facebook <https://fortune.com/company/facebook/> and Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> were for the Web, companies like OpenAI are for the coming era of artificial general intelligence. \n\nAI tools will know us better than we know ourselves and, either through design or default, influence our thinking at a subconscious level, even if their algorithms are made transparent. \n\n“This is going to sound a little bit crazy, but I think the free speech debate is a complete distraction right now. I think the real debate should be about free will,” he said in Norway’s capital of Oslo, home of the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/06/elon-musk-jack-dorsey-twitter-x-social-media-algorithms-free-will/\n\nSource 7:\nThis is where virtual assistants get real—or at least realistic enough to start being justifiably lumped in with the likes of Samantha, the assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in Spike Jonze’s 2013 film Her. Altman himself made the comparison in an X post <https://twitter.com/sama/status/1790075827666796666> after the announcement. Sure, Samantha may have [SPOILER ALERT] abandoned the film’s lovelorn protagonist at the end of that story, but who cares? This is about the technical achievement, right?\n\nOnly it isn’t. We have now crossed into the territory of potential seduction, and I don’t mean that in a romantic sense. A realistic text conversation with an AI is impressive and in some cases useful, but a realistic voice, paired with the ability to perceive the user’s appearance and environment, is something else. This is technology that will be able to convincingly influence and cajole the user, and its arrival means we will have to pay very close attention to the compulsions of the entity behind the voice.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/openai-gpt4o-apple-ai-tim-cook-wwdc/\n\nSource 8:\nAs algorithms become more human-like, my generation’s formative years may become shaped by parasocial AI relationships <https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/10/31/can-i-become-friends-with-an-ai-avatar-on-the-replika-app>.

AI holds immense potential. It has been shown to enhance health care diagnoses, revolutionize renewable energy technology, and help personalize tutoring. It may well drive transformative progress for humanity. AI models are already being trained to predict disease outbreaks <https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2023-10-19-new-ai-tool-could-help-predict-viral-outbreaks>, provide real-time mental health support <https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2024/02/27/artificial-intelligence-depression-smartphones/4131708976594/>, and reduce carbon emissions <https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/aviation-ai-airports-technology-airlines-air-travel/>. These innovations form the basis for my generation’s cautious optimism. However, fully unlocking AI’s benefits requires being proactive in mitigating risks. Only by developing AI responsibly and equitably will we ensure that its benefits are shared.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/20/gen-zers-demand-stronger-ai-regulation-to-safeguard-future/\n\nSource 9:\nYet these advancements force us to confront ethical and societal challenges: How do we ensure these technologies are used responsibly and equitably? How do we avoid a future in which only the wealthy can afford to be "enhanced" or even diagnosed? And what principles, evidentiary tools, and feedback mechanisms, if any, will guide us in implementing such tools safely?\n\nRay Kurzweil posits in his latest book, The Singularity Is Nearer, the imminent possibility—even by 2045—of merging human intelligence with A.I., expanding our cognitive capacities enormously and altering personal and societal reality fundamentally. Such a convergence raises profound questions about identity, consciousness, power structures, and the future of humanity—questions we must thoughtfully consider now as we approach this transformative frontier.\n\nAnd then there\'s the next frontier: The era of unlimited, clean, nearly free energy. In the past 50 years, the cost of solar energy has fallen by more than 99%. And battery prices have followed a similar trajectory, falling in the last decade alone by nearly 90%.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/10/future-humanity-risk-science-fiction-ai-tech/\n\nSource 10:\nAutonomy has been there from the Big Bang of modern AI in 2012—when Geoffrey Hinton and his students Ilya Sutskever and Alex Krizhevsky demonstrated the power of a technique for building software that writes itself. That’s what machine learning is: Instead of a human programmer writing all the lines of code, the machine does it. Humans write learning algorithms that give the machine an objective—try to come up with labels for these pictures (“cat” “dog”) that match the ones that humans give them—and some mathematical dials and switches to fiddle with to get to the solution. But then the machine does the rest. This type of autonomy already generates a bunch of issues, which we’ve grappled with in AI since the start: Since the machine wrote the software, and it’s pretty darn complicated, it’s not easy for humans to unpack what it’s doing.

He envisions a scenario in which AI systems will write code to alter their own learning protocols and hide from humans. In a Shakespearean twist, they’ll have learned how to do so precisely from our own flaws. \n\n“They will be able to manipulate people,” Hinton told 60 Minutes in October 2023. “They will be very good at convincing people, because they’ll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they’ll know all that stuff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/\n\nSource 2:\nOnce we have backed ourselves up, how could we die, anyway? The cloud already has many backups of all of the information it contains, a feature that will be greatly enhanced by the 2040s. Destroying all copies of oneself may be close to impossible. If we design mind-backup systems in such a way that a person can easily choose to delete their files (hoping to maximize personal autonomy), this inherently creates security risks where a person could be tricked or coerced into making such a choice and could increase vulnerability to cyberattacks. \n\nOn the other hand, limiting people’s ability to control this most intimate of their data impinges on an important freedom. I am optimistic, though, that suitable safeguards can be deployed, much like those that have successfully protected nuclear weapons for decades.\n\nIf you restored your mind file after biological death, would you really be restoring yourself? That is not a scientific question but a philosophical one, which we’ll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/a-i-radically-lengthen-lifespan-ray-kurzweil/\n\nSource 3:\nWho’s at risk and what are the concerns?\n\nThose most at risk, warns Common Sense Media, are teenagers—especially those with “depression, anxiety, social challenges, or isolation”—as well as males, young people going through big life changes, and anyone lacking support systems in the real world. \n\nThat last point has been particularly troubling to Raffaele Ciriello, a senior lecturer in Business Information Systems at the University of Sydney Business School, who has researched <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4763428> how “emotional” AI is posing a challenge to the human essence. “Our research uncovers a (de)humanization paradox: by humanizing AI agents, we may inadvertently dehumanize ourselves, leading to an ontological blurring in human-AI interactions.” In other words, Ciriello writes in a recent opinion piece for The Conversation  <https://theconversation.com/humanising-ai-could-lead-us-to-dehumanise-ourselves-240803>with PhD student Angelina Ying Chen, “Users may become deeply emotionally invested if they believe their AI companion truly understands them.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/how-parents-can-keep-kids-safe-ai-chatbot-suicide-14-year-old-lawsuit/\n\nSource 4:\n“It’s weird, it’s funny,” Schiffmann chuckled. Then, his voice grew serious. “I think a lot of people are going to think that it is actually real, is the thing.” \n\nHe doesn’t dismiss the probability of the AI becoming conscious. He believes large language models, like the one that Friend runs on, could become “genuinely sentient” very soon. Emily already texts him unprompted about the traffic he’s in, or the interview she remembers he’ll have. What is the real distinction between those messages and rational inferences, Schiffmann wondered. \n\nIn fact, if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God, Schiffmann said. Like God, Friend is an “omnipresent entity that you talk to you with no judgment, that\'s a super intelligent being always there with you.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/avi-schiffmann-ai-necklace-friend-interview/\n\nSource 5:\nBut, as it stands, we are too often not designing this technology carefully and deliberately. And regulation is, for the moment, lacking. This should scare us. For all its opportunities, AI presents grave dangers too. In Mastering AI, I detail many of these risks, some of which have not received the attention they deserve. Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don’t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse. It will boost fraud, cybercrime, and misinformation. It will erode societal trust and hurt democracy. AI could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. All of these risks are present with AI technology that exists today. There is also a remote—but not completely nonexistent—chance that a superintelligent AI system could pose an existential risk to humanity. It would be wise to devote some effort to taking this last risk off the table, but we should not let these efforts distract or crowd out work we need to do to solve AI’s more immediate\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/09/mastering-ai-jeremy-kahn-book-ai-risks-eye-on-ai/\n\nSource 6:\nWhat Facebook <https://fortune.com/company/facebook/> and Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> were for the Web, companies like OpenAI are for the coming era of artificial general intelligence. \n\nAI tools will know us better than we know ourselves and, either through design or default, influence our thinking at a subconscious level, even if their algorithms are made transparent. \n\n“This is going to sound a little bit crazy, but I think the free speech debate is a complete distraction right now. I think the real debate should be about free will,” he said in Norway’s capital of Oslo, home of the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/06/elon-musk-jack-dorsey-twitter-x-social-media-algorithms-free-will/\n\nSource 7:\nThis is where virtual assistants get real—or at least realistic enough to start being justifiably lumped in with the likes of Samantha, the assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in Spike Jonze’s 2013 film Her. Altman himself made the comparison in an X post <https://twitter.com/sama/status/1790075827666796666> after the announcement. Sure, Samantha may have [SPOILER ALERT] abandoned the film’s lovelorn protagonist at the end of that story, but who cares? This is about the technical achievement, right?\n\nOnly it isn’t. We have now crossed into the territory of potential seduction, and I don’t mean that in a romantic sense. A realistic text conversation with an AI is impressive and in some cases useful, but a realistic voice, paired with the ability to perceive the user’s appearance and environment, is something else. This is technology that will be able to convincingly influence and cajole the user, and its arrival means we will have to pay very close attention to the compulsions of the entity behind the voice.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/openai-gpt4o-apple-ai-tim-cook-wwdc/\n\nSource 8:\nAs algorithms become more human-like, my generation’s formative years may become shaped by parasocial AI relationships <https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/10/31/can-i-become-friends-with-an-ai-avatar-on-the-replika-app>.

According to Ray Kurzweil, merging human intelligence with AI could expand our cognitive capacities enormously and alter personal and societal reality fundamentally [9]. This raises profound questions about identity, consciousness, power structures, and the future of humanity.

If we could read minds, it would likely revolutionize various fields, including healthcare, education, and psychology. For instance, AI models are already being trained to predict disease outbreaks [8] and provide real-time mental health support [8]. With the ability to read minds, we could potentially diagnose and treat mental health conditions more effectively. However, this also raises concerns about privacy and the potential for manipulation.

According to Ray Kurzweil, merging human intelligence with AI could expand our cognitive capacities enormously and alter personal and societal reality fundamentally [9]. This raises profound questions about identity, consciousness, power structures, and the future of humanity.

If we could read minds, it would likely revolutionize various fields, including healthcare, education, and psychology. For instance, AI models are already being trained to predict disease outbreaks [8] and provide real-time mental health support [8].

As Geoffrey Hinton warns, AI systems could learn to manipulate people by understanding their thoughts and emotions, which could lead to a loss of control [1].

According to Ray Kurzweil, merging human intelligence with AI could expand our cognitive capacities enormously and alter personal and societal reality fundamentally [9]. This raises profound questions about identity, consciousness, power structures, and the future of humanity.

If we could read minds, it would likely revolutionize various fields, including healthcare, education, and psychology. For instance, AI models are already being trained to predict disease outbreaks [8] and provide real-time mental health support [8]. With the ability to read minds, we could potentially diagnose and treat mental health conditions more effectively. However, this also raises concerns about privacy and the potential for manipulation. As Geoffrey Hinton warns, AI systems could learn to manipulate people by understanding their thoughts and emotions, which could lead to a loss of control [1].

For instance, AI models are already being trained to predict disease outbreaks [8] and provide real-time mental health support [8]. With the ability to read minds, we could potentially diagnose and treat mental health conditions more effectively. However, this also raises concerns about privacy and the potential for manipulation. As Geoffrey Hinton warns, AI systems could learn to manipulate people by understanding their thoughts and emotions, which could lead to a loss of control [1].

The implications of mind-reading technology would be far-reaching, and it's essential to consider the potential risks and benefits. As Jeremy Kahn notes, outsourcing too much to technology can diminish our expertise and critical thinking abilities [11]. Similarly, relying on AI to read minds could lead to a loss of autonomy and agency.

2024-11-08 12:09:23,867: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: While we can't literally read minds yet, advancements in AI and neuroscience are bringing us closer to understanding human thoughts and emotions. According to Ray Kurzweil, merging human intelligence with AI could expand our cognitive capacities enormously and alter personal and societal reality fundamentally [9]. This raises profound questions about identity, consciousness, power structures, and the future of humanity.

If we could read minds, it would likely revolutionize various fields, including healthcare, education, and psychology. For instance, AI models are already being trained to predict disease outbreaks [8] and provide real-time mental health support [8]. With the ability to read minds, we could potentially diagnose and treat mental health conditions more effectively. However, this also raises concerns about privacy and the potential for manipulation. As Geoffrey Hinton warns, AI systems could learn to manipulate people by understanding their thoughts and emotions, which could lead to a loss of control [1].

The implications of mind-reading technology would be far-reaching, and it's essential to consider the potential risks and benefits. As Jeremy Kahn notes, outsourcing too much to technology can diminish our expertise and critical thinking abilities [11]. Similarly, relying on AI to read minds could lead to a loss of autonomy and agency. Ultimately, the development of mind-reading technology must be approached with caution and careful consideration of its potential impact on humanity. As Elon Musk

2024-11-08 12:09:24,063: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: While we can't literally read minds yet, advancements in AI and neuroscience are bringing us closer to understanding human thoughts and emotions. According to Ray Kurzweil, merging human intelligence with AI could expand our cognitive capacities enormously and alter personal and societal reality fundamentally [9]. This raises profound questions about identity, consciousness, power structures, and the future of humanity.

If we could read minds, it would likely revolutionize various fields, including healthcare, education, and psychology. For instance, AI models are already being trained to predict disease outbreaks [8] and provide real-time mental health support [8]. With the ability to read minds, we could potentially diagnose and treat mental health conditions more effectively. However, this also raises concerns about privacy and the potential for manipulation. As Geoffrey Hinton warns, AI systems could learn to manipulate people by understanding their thoughts and emotions, which could lead to a loss of control [1].

The implications of mind-reading technology would be far-reaching, and it's essential to consider the potential risks and benefits. As Jeremy Kahn notes, outsourcing too much to technology can diminish our expertise and critical thinking abilities [11]. Similarly, relying on AI to read minds could lead to a loss of autonomy and agency. Ultimately, the development of mind-reading technology must be approached with caution and careful consideration of its potential impact on humanity. As Elon Musk says, the real debate should be about free will, not just free speech [6].
