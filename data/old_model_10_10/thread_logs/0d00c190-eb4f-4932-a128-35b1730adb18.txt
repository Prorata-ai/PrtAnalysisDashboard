Instead, he found himself in an escalating online confrontation with Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X.\n\nNow, the UK is mulling steps to tighten the regulation of platforms like Musk’s — and finding it has few levers, especially when the owner is a major amplifier of misinformation. One step would be to revive a key provision in the Online Safety Act, set to be implemented later this year, giving authorities more power to force social media companies to curb harmful content, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\n“Very swiftly the government has realised there needs to be amendments to the Online Safety Act,” London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the Guardian newspaper. “I think what the government should do very quickly is check if it is fit for purpose. I think it’s not fit for purpose.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/09/elon-musk-riot-comments-uk-tougher-social-media-rules-x-meta-twitter-google-alphabet-tiktok/\n\nSource 9:\nUK officials are discussing whether to revisit part of the Online Safety Act, according to the people familiar with the efforts. The bill was watered down by the last government, which removed language that would have regulated “legal but harmful” content in order to allay concerns of free speech campaigners. The legislation gives regulators the power to impose large fines and, in extreme cases, block social media platforms that don’t comply.\n\nOn Monday, Kyle’s office said he met with executives from Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, TikTok and X to discuss “the spread of hateful misinformation and incitement.”\n\nAfter over 30 minutes, Musk appears to have finally deleted the post \n\nNo acknowledgement yet\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/09/elon-musk-riot-comments-uk-tougher-social-media-rules-x-meta-twitter-google-alphabet-tiktok/"}

However, the blame could be pinned on a mounting worklessness crisis in the U.K.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/04/think-about-europe-but-everything-a-little-worse-the-u-k-economy-could-stare-down-long-term-irrelevance-without-immigration/\n\nSource 4:\nEconomic inactivity has been soaring in the country, accelerated by a growing long-term sickness trend and youth unemployment <https://fortune.com/europe/2024/03/14/youth-mental-health-crisis-uk-3-million-gen-zers-labor-force/>.\n\nThe country hasn’t been able to benefit from migration flows to offset a tight labor market, unlike in the European Union’s common market. \n\nAs a small open economy, the U.K. has also been more vulnerable than the EU to a flight of capital following market shocks, as summed up by the currency hammering budget of September 2022. \n\nEisenschmidt said these pressures left the U.K. “more exposed to the need for household discipline” in the short run. \n\nThe outcome of this year’s U.K. General Election, the date of which is pending, is another major short-term variable impacting the fortunes of the economy.\n\nAging populations\n\nA trend of labor market flows having an outsized impact on economic performance is one the U.K. should get used to.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/04/think-about-europe-but-everything-a-little-worse-the-u-k-economy-could-stare-down-long-term-irrelevance-without-immigration/\n\nSource 5:\nJulia Hoggett, chief executive officer of London Stock Exchange Plc, speaks during The Power of Action: LGBTQIA+ Inclusion event panel discussion at Bloomberg LP's European headquarters in London, UK, on Thursday, June 22, 2023.

The number of international investors saw a similar decline, falling from 437 in H1 2023 to 326 in 2024.\n\nWith the arrival of new U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, many will be hoping that the first Labour government in 14 years will continue to support the U.K.’s position as a critical player in the global tech landscape.\n\nCorrection, July 8, 2024: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Mews was founded in Amsterdam.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/07/05/uk-tech-overtakes-china-cementing-position-worlds-second-largest-ecosystem-funding/\n\nSource 7:\nBrokers chalk much of the market uncertainty to July’s election, which was well-flagged to be a shift in government during the proceeding year. The Labour party, which won a resounding victory, had been consistently polling higher than the Conservatives, who had been in power for over a decade. High interest rates also weighed on sentiment; the Bank of England delivered its first cut in four years <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-01/the-bank-of-england-finally-delivers-that-rate-cut> just this August.\n\nUncertainty has now shifted onto the ramifications of the new government, specifically uncertainty surrounding a new tax regime, says Stuart Bailey, head of super prime sales London at Knight Frank. Tax hikes have been floated by the new Labour government <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/uk-s-richest-face-prospect-of-sharp-labour-tax-hikes-on-wealth>, including possible increases to capital gains and inheritance taxes, which will be revealed in the upcoming UK budget, set for Oct. 30.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/09/21/london-housing-real-estate/\n\nSource 8:\nExperts suggest that addressing productivity doesn’t have a one-shot <https://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/uk-productivity-paralysis> solution. It will take years of deliberate efforts to invest in skills and training while also improving job opportunities and access to health care for the next generation of workers. \n\nThe Bank of England’s course with interest rates will also help determine what’s in store for the economy. \n\nThe Labour Party has promised to focus on “sustainable growth.” With the budget due to be announced on Oct. 30, it will have to iron out specific steps that address productivity and worklessness to jump-start economic growth.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/10/britain-workforce-productivity-youth-worklessness/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/10/britain-workforce-productivity-youth-worklessness/\n\nSource 9:\nKeir Starmer called for a “mature conversation” with social media companies to limit malicious content that’s stoked days of rioting in the UK. Instead, he found himself in an escalating online confrontation with Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X.\n\nNow, the UK is mulling steps to tighten the regulation of platforms like Musk’s — and finding it has few levers, especially when the owner is a major amplifier of misinformation. One step would be to revive a key provision in the Online Safety Act, set to be implemented later this year, giving authorities more power to force social media companies to curb harmful content, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\n“Very swiftly the government has realised there needs to be amendments to the Online Safety Act,” London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the Guardian newspaper. “I think what the government should do very quickly is check if it is fit for purpose. I think it’s not fit for purpose.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/09/elon-musk-riot-comments-uk-tougher-social-media-rules-x-meta-twitter-google-alphabet-tiktok/\n\nSource 9:\nUK officials are discussing whether to revisit part of the Online Safety Act, according to the people familiar with the efforts. The bill was watered down by the last government, which removed language that would have regulated “legal but harmful” content in order to allay concerns of free speech campaigners. The legislation gives regulators the power to impose large fines and, in extreme cases, block social media platforms that don’t comply.\n\nOn Monday, Kyle’s office said he met with executives from Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, TikTok and X to discuss “the spread of hateful misinformation and incitement.”\n\nAfter over 30 minutes, Musk appears to have finally deleted the post \n\nNo acknowledgement yet\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/09/elon-musk-riot-comments-uk-tougher-social-media-rules-x-meta-twitter-google-alphabet-tiktok/"}
