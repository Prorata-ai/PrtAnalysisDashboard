The function of Jupiter-C was to hurl experimental nose cones 1,500 to 3,000 miles down the Atlantic Missile Range to see if they could survive their fiery re-entry into the atmosphere. However, von Braun and William Pickering, director of J.P.L., carefully calculated weights and thrusts so that if the Jupiter-C's fourth stage were loaded and fired, the nose cone would overshoot the testing range and fly into orbit. In September, 1956, with its fourth stage unfueled, Jupiter-C made a record flight of 3,700 miles. Thus, more than a year before Sputnik I, the U.S. could almost certainly have placed the world's first satellite in orbit. But a Jupiter-C was not fired with all stages properly fueled until January 31, 1958, and by then it was too late to win anything but second place. During 1958, Jupiter-C's launched three of the five successful U.S. satellites: Explorers I, III, and IV, which carried scientific payloads of eighteen to twenty-six pounds.

Obviously, the U.S. is energetically rushing satellites for the same sorts of missions. These efforts are not seriously handicapped by the official U.S. position, expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, "that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind." Important military uses of space were visualized by a few scientists at the close of World War II. More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit. In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning. The sensing devices in Midas will presumably be infrared, or heat, detectors.

When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled "Introduction to Outer Space," prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, "This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists." This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact. Since the testimony, running to more than 600 pages, is the most complete account yet given of NASA\'s program, some of its highlights are worth recording here.

They had already brought into their new company some of the country\'s leading rocket and electronics experts when the Air Force picked them for the unprecedented ballistic-missile job. From nose cones to satellites To keep the IRBM and ICBM program on its incredibly tight schedule, a high-level government decision was made in 1955 not to allot any of the military missiles to the I.G.Y. program for space exploration. Instead, the nonmilitary Martin Vanguard, based on the Viking--a high-altitude or "sounding" rocket--was designated to loft the nation\'s first satellite. The Naval Research Laboratory was given a parsimonious $20 million for the project, which has now absorbed over $120 million. Chafing under this decision, Major General John B. Medaris, then commander of ABMA, encouraged von Braun to get on with a modification of Redstone called Jupiter-C, which carried enlarged fuel tanks and three upper stages of solid-fuel rockets provided by J.P.L.

In September, 1956, with its fourth stage unfueled, Jupiter-C made a record flight of 3,700 miles.

These efforts are not seriously handicapped by the official U.S. position, expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, "that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind." Important military uses of space were visualized by a few scientists at the close of World War II. More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit.

In the twenty-one months of the new age, the White House, Congress, and the U.S. public have had quite an education. When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled "Introduction to Outer Space," prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, "This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists." This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact.

From nose cones to satellites To keep the IRBM and ICBM program on its incredibly tight schedule, a high-level government decision was made in 1955 not to allot any of the military missiles to the I.G.Y. program for space exploration. Instead, the nonmilitary Martin Vanguard, based on the Viking--a high-altitude or "sounding" rocket--was designated to loft the nation\'s first satellite. The Naval Research Laboratory was given a parsimonious $20 million for the project, which has now absorbed over $120 million. Chafing under this decision, Major General John B. Medaris, then commander of ABMA, encouraged von Braun to get on with a modification of Redstone called Jupiter-C, which carried enlarged fuel tanks and three upper stages of solid-fuel rockets provided by J.P.L.

The function of Jupiter-C was to hurl experimental nose cones 1,500 to 3,000 miles down the Atlantic Missile Range to see if they could survive their fiery re-entry into the atmosphere. However, von Braun and William Pickering, director of J.P.L., carefully calculated weights and thrusts so that if the Jupiter-C's fourth stage were loaded and fired, the nose cone would overshoot the testing range and fly into orbit. In September, 1956, with its fourth stage unfueled, Jupiter-C made a record flight of 3,700 miles.

Obviously, the U.S. is energetically rushing satellites for the same sorts of missions. These efforts are not seriously handicapped by the official U.S. position, expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, "that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind." Important military uses of space were visualized by a few scientists at the close of World War II. More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit. In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning.

In the twenty-one months of the new age, the White House, Congress, and the U.S. public have had quite an education. When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled "Introduction to Outer Space," prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, "This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists." This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact. Since the testimony, running to more than 600 pages, is the most complete account yet given of NASA\'s program, some of its highlights are worth recording here.

From nose cones to satellites To keep the IRBM and ICBM program on its incredibly tight schedule, a high-level government decision was made in 1955 not to allot any of the military missiles to the I.G.Y. program for space exploration. Instead, the nonmilitary Martin Vanguard, based on the Viking--a high-altitude or "sounding" rocket--was designated to loft the nation\'s first satellite. The Naval Research Laboratory was given a parsimonious $20 million for the project, which has now absorbed over $120 million. Chafing under this decision, Major General John B.

With its customary prodigality, the U.S. supported, often haltingly, three separate ballistic-rocket programs in the interval between 1945 and 1958--and in 1958 all three paid off with successful space flights.

The function of Jupiter-C was to hurl experimental nose cones 1,500 to 3,000 miles down the Atlantic Missile Range to see if they could survive their fiery re-entry into the atmosphere. However, von Braun and William Pickering, director of J.P.L., carefully calculated weights and thrusts so that if the Jupiter-C's fourth stage were loaded and fired, the nose cone would overshoot the testing range and fly into orbit. In September, 1956, with its fourth stage unfueled, Jupiter-C made a record flight of 3,700 miles. Thus, more than a year before Sputnik I, the U.S. could almost certainly have placed the world's first satellite in orbit.

In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning.

It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact.

They had already brought into their new company some of the country\'s leading rocket and electronics experts when the Air Force picked them for the unprecedented ballistic-missile job. From nose cones to satellites To keep the IRBM and ICBM program on its incredibly tight schedule, a high-level government decision was made in 1955 not to allot any of the military missiles to the I.G.Y. program for space exploration. Instead, the nonmilitary Martin Vanguard, based on the Viking--a high-altitude or "sounding" rocket--was designated to loft the nation\'s first satellite.

Last December, AFBMD orbited the entire empty shell of an Atlas-the "talking" Atlas that broadcast a Christmas message from President Eisenhower. Thors have boosted the heaviest U.S. payloads to date, and Thors and Atlases--and probably Titans--will have growing roles in the space program. There has been intense and understandable rivalry among the three groups, but in countless formal and informal ways the experience and knowledge gained by one have generally been passed on to the others. How this transfer and diffusion of information takes place is one of the marvels of the American industrial system. Space operations require the creation of larger industrial complexes than ever before worked together in peacetime.

However, von Braun and William Pickering, director of J.P.L., carefully calculated weights and thrusts so that if the Jupiter-C\'s fourth stage were loaded and fired, the nose cone would overshoot the testing range and fly into orbit. In September, 1956, with its fourth stage unfueled, Jupiter-C made a record flight of 3,700 miles. Thus, more than a year before Sputnik I, the U.S. could almost certainly have placed the world\'s first satellite in orbit.

These efforts are not seriously handicapped by the official U.S. position, expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, "that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind." Important military uses of space were visualized by a few scientists at the close of World War II. More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit. In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning. The sensing devices in Midas will presumably be infrared, or heat, detectors.

If a suitably equipped satellite were spotted precisely over the equator, slightly west of the tip of India, Russia could use it to beam radio and television messages to virtually any point on the entire Afro-Eurasian land mass. Three such satellites of reasonable size spaced equidistantly around the equator could provide the Russians with over a hundred voice channels and several thousand teletype channels to virtually any point on earth. If the Soviets really fear that the U.S. might start a "preemptive" missile war, they may choose, instead, to give first priority to satellites that could keep the U.S. under continuous surveillance, and provide early warning of a ballistic-missile attack. Suitable devices in such satellites could provide photographic reconnaissance of the U.S. as well as instantaneous detection of the great heat blasts produced by the firing of a rocket engine.

Premier Khrushchev once proposed that the U.S. and Russia compete in a friendly "shooting match" to test the accuracy of the ICBM\'s of the two nations. The space contest actually in progress is more pervasive and far more fateful for world history than the match Khrushchev proposed. And, on the record to date, Russia is ahead. Most U.S. rocket experts expect to see before the year is out another major Russian achievement at least as exciting as the Mechta shot past the moon in January. It may be placing a man in orbit, or landing an instrument package on the moon. On the other hand, Russia may decide to try for an immediate military-political payoff by putting a communication satellite into a twenty-four-hour orbit, 22,000 miles above the equator.

In the twenty-one months of the new age, the White House, Congress, and the U.S. public have had quite an education. When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled "Introduction to Outer Space," prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, "This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists." This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact. Since the testimony, running to more than 600 pages, is the most complete account yet given of NASA\'s program, some of its highlights are worth recording here. Mapping and cloud hunting During the rest of 1959 and 1960, NASA expects to fire a total of nearly 150 sounding rockets to gather detailed information on the earth\'s\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-early-space-age-fortune-1959/\n\nSource 1:\nof Thompson Ramo Wooldridge. Ramo Wooldridge was formed in late 1953 by two brilliant scientist-engineers, Simon Ramo and Dean Wooldridge, who had pulled out of Hughes Aircraft. They had already brought into their new company some of the country\'s leading rocket and electronics experts when the Air Force picked them for the unprecedented ballistic-missile job. From nose cones to satellites To keep the IRBM and ICBM program on its incredibly tight schedule, a high-level government decision was made in 1955 not to allot any of the military missiles to the I.G.Y. program for space exploration. Instead, the nonmilitary Martin Vanguard, based on the Viking--a high-altitude or "sounding" rocket--was designated to loft the nation\'s first satellite. The Naval Research Laboratory was given a parsimonious $20 million for the project, which has now absorbed over $120 million. Chafing under this decision, Major General John B. Medaris, then commander of ABMA, encouraged von Braun to get on with a modification of Redstone called Jupiter-C, which carried enlarged fuel tanks and three upper stages of solid-fuel rockets provided by J.P.L.

The entire program is under the technical direction of Space Technology Laboratories, a subsidiary of Thompson Ramo Wooldridge. Last December, AFBMD orbited the entire empty shell of an Atlas-the "talking" Atlas that broadcast a Christmas message from President Eisenhower. Thors have boosted the heaviest U.S. payloads to date, and Thors and Atlases--and probably Titans--will have growing roles in the space program. There has been intense and understandable rivalry among the three groups, but in countless formal and informal ways the experience and knowledge gained by one have generally been passed on to the others. How this transfer and diffusion of information takes place is one of the marvels of the American industrial system. Space operations require the creation of larger industrial complexes than ever before worked together in peacetime. The outstanding example of this is the great group of companies brought together by the AFBMD to create Thor, Atlas, and Titan.

A later satellite will carry a TV camera to photograph clouds in a sequential strip about 800 miles wide, and thus tell meteorologists for the first time what the weather looks like over the vast unmonitored expanses of the world\'s oceans. To provide better global communications NASA is working with the ARPA, and will undertake a number of experiments of its own. This year NASA plans to put up a "passive" communication satellite, consisting of a sphere of Mylar plastic film. 100 feet in diameter, which will be inflated after going into orbit at an altitude of 1,000 miles. The aluminized surface of the sphere will reflect high-power radio signals beamed upward from the ground. Messages bounced off the sphere will travel between J.P.L.\'s big tracking antenna at Goldstone, California, and similar antennas operated on the east coast by Bell Telephone Laboratories and others. The back of the moon Toward the end of the year NASA will try to put a small instrument package, lofted by an Atlas-Able (smaller than Atlas-Vega), into orbit around the moon.

The military half of the U.S. space program, currently absorbing about half a billion dollars a year, is under the control of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which was set up by Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy in February, 1958. ARPA\'s director, Roy W. Johnson, formerly executive vice president of General Electric <https://fortune.com/company/general-electric/>, defines the services’ function in space in these words: "Our military task is to master the region under the radiation belts, that is, the region out to about 600 miles. We are going to have to learn to maneuver out there and to carry out military missions, and I am sure we will need men to do it."

With its customary prodigality, the U.S. supported, often haltingly, three separate ballistic-rocket programs in the interval between 1945 and 1958--and in 1958 all three paid off with successful space flights. The three separate routes to space were: • The Redstone-Jupiter missile effort of the German-born experts under Wernher von Braun at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. With upper stages and payloads produced by Cal Tech\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Army missiles put three Explorers into orbit in 1958, and on March 3 of this year sent the 13.4-pound Pioneer IV chasing after 3,245-pound Mechta, on its endless journey around the sun. • The Viking-Vanguard <https://fortune.com/company/vanguard/> program conducted by Martin for the Naval Research Laboratory.

In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning. The sensing devices in Midas will presumably be infrared, or heat, detectors. Half a dozen or so polar-orbit satellites, spaced one behind the other, could maintain a constant patrol over\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-early-space-age-fortune-1959/\n\nSource 1:\nwill revolve once around the earth in exactly twenty-four hours and thus, if rotating eastward, will appear to stand motionless in space. If a suitably equipped satellite were spotted precisely over the equator, slightly west of the tip of India, Russia could use it to beam radio and television messages to virtually any point on the entire Afro-Eurasian land mass. Three such satellites of reasonable size spaced equidistantly around the equator could provide the Russians with over a hundred voice channels and several thousand teletype channels to virtually any point on earth. If the Soviets really fear that the U.S. might start a "preemptive" missile war, they may choose, instead, to give first priority to satellites that could keep the U.S. under continuous surveillance, and provide early warning of a ballistic-missile attack. Suitable devices in such satellites could provide photographic reconnaissance of the U.S. as well as instantaneous detection of the great heat blasts produced by the firing of a rocket engine.

The Space Age will test the ability of two very different societies to mobilize their industrial skills, to draw up long-range plans, to make complex decisions, to educate for the tremendous scientific challenges ahead, and to create congenial environments for some of their most creative minds. Premier Khrushchev once proposed that the U.S. and Russia compete in a friendly "shooting match" to test the accuracy of the ICBM\'s of the two nations. The space contest actually in progress is more pervasive and far more fateful for world history than the match Khrushchev proposed. And, on the record to date, Russia is ahead. Most U.S. rocket experts expect to see before the year is out another major Russian achievement at least as exciting as the Mechta shot past the moon in January. It may be placing a man in orbit, or landing an instrument package on the moon. On the other hand, Russia may decide to try for an immediate military-political payoff by putting a communication satellite into a twenty-four-hour orbit, 22,000 miles above the equator.

In the twenty-one months of the new age, the White House, Congress, and the U.S. public have had quite an education. When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled "Introduction to Outer Space," prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, "This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists." This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact. Since the testimony, running to more than 600 pages, is the most complete account yet given of NASA\'s program, some of its highlights are worth recording here.

They had already brought into their new company some of the country\'s leading rocket and electronics experts when the Air Force picked them for the unprecedented ballistic-missile job. From nose cones to satellites To keep the IRBM and ICBM program on its incredibly tight schedule, a high-level government decision was made in 1955 not to allot any of the military missiles to the I.G.Y. program for space exploration. Instead, the nonmilitary Martin Vanguard, based on the Viking--a high-altitude or "sounding" rocket--was designated to loft the nation\'s first satellite. The Naval Research Laboratory was given a parsimonious $20 million for the project, which has now absorbed over $120 million. Chafing under this decision, Major General John B. Medaris, then commander of ABMA, encouraged von Braun to get on with a modification of Redstone called Jupiter-C, which carried enlarged fuel tanks and three upper stages of solid-fuel rockets provided by J.P.L.

There has been intense and understandable rivalry among the three groups, but in countless formal and informal ways the experience and knowledge gained by one have generally been passed on to the others. How this transfer and diffusion of information takes place is one of the marvels of the American industrial system.

With its customary prodigality, the U.S. supported, often haltingly, three separate ballistic-rocket programs in the interval between 1945 and 1958--and in 1958 all three paid off with successful space flights. The three separate routes to space were: • The Redstone-Jupiter missile effort of the German-born experts under Wernher von Braun at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. With upper stages and payloads produced by Cal Tech\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Army missiles put three Explorers into orbit in 1958, and on March 3 of this year sent the 13.4-pound Pioneer IV chasing after 3,245-pound Mechta, on its endless journey around the sun. • The Viking-Vanguard <https://fortune.com/company/vanguard/> program conducted by Martin for the Naval Research Laboratory.

The function of Jupiter-C was to hurl experimental nose cones 1,500 to 3,000 miles down the Atlantic Missile Range to see if they could survive their fiery re-entry into the atmosphere. However, von Braun and William Pickering, director of J.P.L., carefully calculated weights and thrusts so that if the Jupiter-C\'s fourth stage were loaded and fired, the nose cone would overshoot the testing range and fly into orbit. In September, 1956, with its fourth stage unfueled, Jupiter-C made a record flight of 3,700 miles. Thus, more than a year before Sputnik I, the U.S. could almost certainly have placed the world\'s first satellite in orbit. But a Jupiter-C was not fired with all stages properly fueled until January 31, 1958, and by then it was too late to win anything but second place. During 1958, Jupiter-C\'s launched three of the five successful U.S. satellites: Explorers I, III, and IV, which carried scientific payloads of eighteen to twenty-six pounds.

The function of Jupiter-C was to hurl experimental nose cones 1,500 to 3,000 miles down the Atlantic Missile Range to see if they could survive their fiery re-entry into the atmosphere. However, von Braun and William Pickering, director of J.P.L., carefully calculated weights and thrusts so that if the Jupiter-C\'s fourth stage were loaded and fired, the nose cone would overshoot the testing range and fly into orbit. In September, 1956, with its fourth stage unfueled, Jupiter-C made a record flight of 3,700 miles. Thus, more than a year before Sputnik I, the U.S. could almost certainly have placed the world\'s first satellite in orbit. But a Jupiter-C was not fired with all stages properly fueled until January 31, 1958, and by then it was too late to win anything but second place. During 1958, Jupiter-C\'s launched three of the five successful U.S. satellites: Explorers I, III, and IV, which carried scientific payloads of eighteen to twenty-six pounds. The two other successful shots were the 3.3-pound Vanguard I (which also put a fifty-pound rocket case into\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-early-space-age-fortune-1959/\n\nSource 1:\n<http://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/earth_satellite_orbits_large.jpg> Click to enlarge. Obviously, the U.S. is energetically rushing satellites for the same sorts of missions. These efforts are not seriously handicapped by the official U.S. position, expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, "that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind." Important military uses of space were visualized by a few scientists at the close of World War II. More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit. In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning. The sensing devices in Midas will presumably be infrared, or heat, detectors. Half a dozen or so polar-orbit satellites, spaced one behind the other, could maintain a constant patrol over\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-early-space-age-fortune-1959/\n\nSource 1:\nwill revolve once around the earth in exactly twenty-four hours and thus, if rotating eastward, will appear to stand motionless in space. If a suitably equipped satellite were spotted precisely over the equator, slightly west of the tip of India, Russia could use it to beam radio and television messages to virtually any point on the entire Afro-Eurasian land mass. Three such satellites of reasonable size spaced equidistantly around the equator could provide the Russians with over a hundred voice channels and several thousand teletype channels to virtually any point on earth. If the Soviets really fear that the U.S. might start a "preemptive" missile war, they may choose, instead, to give first priority to satellites that could keep the U.S. under continuous surveillance, and provide early warning of a ballistic-missile attack. Suitable devices in such satellites could provide photographic reconnaissance of the U.S. as well as instantaneous detection of the great heat blasts produced by the firing of a rocket engine.

The Space Age will test the ability of two very different societies to mobilize their industrial skills, to draw up long-range plans, to make complex decisions, to educate for the tremendous scientific challenges ahead, and to create congenial environments for some of their most creative minds. Premier Khrushchev once proposed that the U.S. and Russia compete in a friendly "shooting match" to test the accuracy of the ICBM\'s of the two nations. The space contest actually in progress is more pervasive and far more fateful for world history than the match Khrushchev proposed. And, on the record to date, Russia is ahead. Most U.S. rocket experts expect to see before the year is out another major Russian achievement at least as exciting as the Mechta shot past the moon in January. It may be placing a man in orbit, or landing an instrument package on the moon. On the other hand, Russia may decide to try for an immediate military-political payoff by putting a communication satellite into a twenty-four-hour orbit, 22,000 miles above the equator.

In the twenty-one months of the new age, the White House, Congress, and the U.S. public have had quite an education. When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled "Introduction to Outer Space," prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, "This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists." This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact. Since the testimony, running to more than 600 pages, is the most complete account yet given of NASA\'s program, some of its highlights are worth recording here. Mapping and cloud hunting During the rest of 1959 and 1960, NASA expects to fire a total of nearly 150 sounding rockets to gather detailed information on the earth\'s\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-early-space-age-fortune-1959/\n\nSource 1:\nof Thompson Ramo Wooldridge. Ramo Wooldridge was formed in late 1953 by two brilliant scientist-engineers, Simon Ramo and Dean Wooldridge, who had pulled out of Hughes Aircraft. They had already brought into their new company some of the country\'s leading rocket and electronics experts when the Air Force picked them for the unprecedented ballistic-missile job. From nose cones to satellites To keep the IRBM and ICBM program on its incredibly tight schedule, a high-level government decision was made in 1955 not to allot any of the military missiles to the I.G.Y. program for space exploration. Instead, the nonmilitary Martin Vanguard, based on the Viking--a high-altitude or "sounding" rocket--was designated to loft the nation\'s first satellite. The Naval Research Laboratory was given a parsimonious $20 million for the project, which has now absorbed over $120 million. Chafing under this decision, Major General John B. Medaris, then commander of ABMA, encouraged von Braun to get on with a modification of Redstone called Jupiter-C, which carried enlarged fuel tanks and three upper stages of solid-fuel rockets provided by J.P.L. The function of Jupiter-C was to hurl experimental nose\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-early-space-age-fortune-1959/\n\nSource 1:\nMartin for the Naval Research Laboratory.

Vanguard I may still be aloft in 2959 A.D. • The Thor-Atlas-Titan program of the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, with Douglas, Convair, and Martin as principal airframe contractors. The entire program is under the technical direction of Space Technology Laboratories, a subsidiary of Thompson Ramo Wooldridge. Last December, AFBMD orbited the entire empty shell of an Atlas-the "talking" Atlas that broadcast a Christmas message from President Eisenhower. Thors have boosted the heaviest U.S. payloads to date, and Thors and Atlases--and probably Titans--will have growing roles in the space program. There has been intense and understandable rivalry among the three groups, but in countless formal and informal ways the experience and knowledge gained by one have generally been passed on to the others. How this transfer and diffusion of information takes place is one of the marvels of the American industrial system. Space operations require the creation of larger industrial complexes than ever before worked together in peacetime. The outstanding example of this is the great group of companies brought together by the AFBMD to create Thor, Atlas, and Titan.

A later satellite will carry a TV camera to photograph clouds in a sequential strip about 800 miles wide, and thus tell meteorologists for the first time what the weather looks like over the vast unmonitored expanses of the world\'s oceans. To provide better global communications NASA is working with the ARPA, and will undertake a number of experiments of its own. This year NASA plans to put up a "passive" communication satellite, consisting of a sphere of Mylar plastic film. 100 feet in diameter, which will be inflated after going into orbit at an altitude of 1,000 miles. The aluminized surface of the sphere will reflect high-power radio signals beamed upward from the ground. Messages bounced off the sphere will travel between J.P.L.\'s big tracking antenna at Goldstone, California, and similar antennas operated on the east coast by Bell Telephone Laboratories and others. The back of the moon Toward the end of the year NASA will try to put a small instrument package, lofted by an Atlas-Able (smaller than Atlas-Vega), into orbit around the moon. A photoelectric scanner aboard may give us the first crude glimpse of the back of the moon before the year is out.

Assuming that Russia sets up a similar patrol over the U.S., it would be just a step to a mutual "open skies" inspection system far more audacious than that originally proposed by President Eisenhower in January, 1955. The military half of the U.S. space program, currently absorbing about half a billion dollars a year, is under the control of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which was set up by Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy in February, 1958. ARPA\'s director, Roy W. Johnson, formerly executive vice president of General Electric <https://fortune.com/company/general-electric/>, defines the services’ function in space in these words: "Our military task is to master the region under the radiation belts, that is, the region out to about 600 miles. We are going to have to learn to maneuver out there and to carry out military missions, and I am sure we will need men to do it." ARPA has ordered a monster 1,500,000-pound-thrust rocket booster, consisting of a cluster of eight engines of the size used in the IRBM\'s and\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-early-space-age-fortune-1959/\n\nSource 1:\n<https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/industrial_managers_21.jpg> The prodigal\'s routes to space So far as anyone in the West knows, the Soviets have moved into space with one vast coordinated effort, embracing military rockets on the one hand and scientific exploration on the other. With its customary prodigality, the U.S. supported, often haltingly, three separate ballistic-rocket programs in the interval between 1945 and 1958--and in 1958 all three paid off with successful space flights. The three separate routes to space were: • The Redstone-Jupiter missile effort of the German-born experts under Wernher von Braun at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. With upper stages and payloads produced by Cal Tech\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Army missiles put three Explorers into orbit in 1958, and on March 3 of this year sent the 13.4-pound Pioneer IV chasing after 3,245-pound Mechta, on its endless journey around the sun. • The Viking-Vanguard <https://fortune.com/company/vanguard/> program conducted by Martin for the Naval Research Laboratory.

2024-11-08 11:48:53,554: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The first artificial Earth satellite is not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources as being launched by the United States. However, it is mentioned that "more than a year before Sputnik I, the U.S. could almost certainly have placed the world's first satellite in orbit" [1]. This implies that Sputnik I was the first artificial Earth satellite, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided sources.

However, according to historical records, Sputnik I was indeed the first artificial Earth satellite, launched by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957. Unfortunately, this information is not present in the provided sources.

The provided sources do mention that the United States launched several satellites in 1958, including Explorers I, III, and IV, which carried scientific payloads of eighteen to twenty-six pounds [1]. Additionally, the sources mention that the Vanguard I satellite was launched and placed a record U.S. payload in orbit [1]. However, these satellites were not the first artificial Earth satellites.
