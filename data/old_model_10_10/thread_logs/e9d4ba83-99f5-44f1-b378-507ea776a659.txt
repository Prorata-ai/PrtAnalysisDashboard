He envisions a scenario in which AI systems will write code to alter their own learning protocols and hide from humans. In a Shakespearean twist, they’ll have learned how to do so precisely from our own flaws. \n\n“They will be able to manipulate people,” Hinton told 60 Minutes in October 2023. “They will be very good at convincing people, because they’ll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they’ll know all that stuff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/\n\nSource 2:\nOnce we have backed ourselves up, how could we die, anyway? The cloud already has many backups of all of the information it contains, a feature that will be greatly enhanced by the 2040s. Destroying all copies of oneself may be close to impossible. If we design mind-backup systems in such a way that a person can easily choose to delete their files (hoping to maximize personal autonomy), this inherently creates security risks where a person could be tricked or coerced into making such a choice and could increase vulnerability to cyberattacks. \n\nOn the other hand, limiting people’s ability to control this most intimate of their data impinges on an important freedom. I am optimistic, though, that suitable safeguards can be deployed, much like those that have successfully protected nuclear weapons for decades.\n\nIf you restored your mind file after biological death, would you really be restoring yourself? That is not a scientific question but a philosophical one, which we’ll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/a-i-radically-lengthen-lifespan-ray-kurzweil/\n\nSource 3:\nWho’s at risk and what are the concerns?\n\nThose most at risk, warns Common Sense Media, are teenagers—especially those with “depression, anxiety, social challenges, or isolation”—as well as males, young people going through big life changes, and anyone lacking support systems in the real world. \n\nThat last point has been particularly troubling to Raffaele Ciriello, a senior lecturer in Business Information Systems at the University of Sydney Business School, who has researched <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4763428> how “emotional” AI is posing a challenge to the human essence. “Our research uncovers a (de)humanization paradox: by humanizing AI agents, we may inadvertently dehumanize ourselves, leading to an ontological blurring in human-AI interactions.” In other words, Ciriello writes in a recent opinion piece for The Conversation  <https://theconversation.com/humanising-ai-could-lead-us-to-dehumanise-ourselves-240803>with PhD student Angelina Ying Chen, “Users may become deeply emotionally invested if they believe their AI companion truly understands them.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/how-parents-can-keep-kids-safe-ai-chatbot-suicide-14-year-old-lawsuit/\n\nSource 4:\nThey offer us freedom from moral choice.\n\nThrough the deification of group harmony, buck-passing a moral decision becomes itself a moral act; the system—as The Caine Mutiny advocates—attends to these things so much better than the individual, and he might just as well relax and enjoy it.\n\nAnd there is freedom in another sense as well. Moral dilemmas exist because there is uncertainty. If we can now abstract a few parts from the whole of human nature and by analysis predict objectively what will make for group harmony, the intangibles that make individual decisions so poignant may be obviated altogether. Like a general who is blessed with perfect intelligence of the enemy, we will have only one valid course of action before us. We will have finally latched on to certainty.\n\nWhy participate?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/groupthink-fortune-1952/\n\nSource 5:\nThose with behavioral and mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression <https://fortune.com/well/article/founder-toms-shoes-mens-retreat-loneliness-depression/>, and ADHD <https://fortune.com/well/article/adult-adhd-symptoms-behavior-diagnosis/>, are also more prone to have overactive brains that scan for problems, prepare, and future-think. “For some, repetitive thoughts can trigger a sense of familiarity that the brain clings to, even if uncomfortable,” Kuburic says. \n\nBut we don’t have to live in this type of familiarity.

Then, his voice grew serious. “I think a lot of people are going to think that it is actually real, is the thing.” \n\nHe doesn’t dismiss the probability of the AI becoming conscious. He believes large language models, like the one that Friend runs on, could become “genuinely sentient” very soon. Emily already texts him unprompted about the traffic he’s in, or the interview she remembers he’ll have. What is the real distinction between those messages and rational inferences, Schiffmann wondered. \n\nIn fact, if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God, Schiffmann said.

He envisions a scenario in which AI systems will write code to alter their own learning protocols and hide from humans. In a Shakespearean twist, they’ll have learned how to do so precisely from our own flaws. \n\n“They will be able to manipulate people,” Hinton told 60 Minutes in October 2023. “They will be very good at convincing people, because they’ll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they’ll know all that stuff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/\n\nSource 2:\nOnce we have backed ourselves up, how could we die, anyway? The cloud already has many backups of all of the information it contains, a feature that will be greatly enhanced by the 2040s. Destroying all copies of oneself may be close to impossible. If we design mind-backup systems in such a way that a person can easily choose to delete their files (hoping to maximize personal autonomy), this inherently creates security risks where a person could be tricked or coerced into making such a choice and could increase vulnerability to cyberattacks. \n\nOn the other hand, limiting people’s ability to control this most intimate of their data impinges on an important freedom. I am optimistic, though, that suitable safeguards can be deployed, much like those that have successfully protected nuclear weapons for decades.\n\nIf you restored your mind file after biological death, would you really be restoring yourself?

Moral dilemmas exist because there is uncertainty. If we can now abstract a few parts from the whole of human nature and by analysis predict objectively what will make for group harmony, the intangibles that make individual decisions so poignant may be obviated altogether.

2024-11-08 11:59:13,261: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on our society and individual relationships. According to Ray Kurzweil, an American inventor and futurist, mind-reading technology could potentially "radically lengthen our lifespan" by allowing us to backup and restore our minds [2]. However, this raises important philosophical questions about the nature of identity and self. If we could restore our mind file after biological death, would we really be restoring ourselves? This is a question that we'll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today [2].

2024-11-08 11:59:13,485: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on our society and individual relationships. According to Ray Kurzweil, an American inventor and futurist, mind-reading technology could potentially "radically lengthen our lifespan" by allowing us to backup and restore our minds [2]. However, this raises important philosophical questions about the nature of identity and self. If we could restore our mind file after biological death, would we really be restoring ourselves? This is a question that we'll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today [2].

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also have significant implications for our personal relationships and social interactions. For instance

2024-11-08 11:59:14,063: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on our society and individual relationships. According to Ray Kurzweil, an American inventor and futurist, mind-reading technology could potentially "radically lengthen our lifespan" by allowing us to backup and restore our minds [2]. However, this raises important philosophical questions about the nature of identity and self. If we could restore our mind file after biological death, would we really be restoring ourselves? This is a question that we'll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today [2].

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also have significant implications for our personal relationships and social interactions.

According to Ray Kurzweil, an American inventor and futurist, mind-reading technology could potentially "radically lengthen our lifespan" by allowing us to backup and restore our minds [2]. However, this raises important philosophical questions about the nature of identity and self. If we could restore our mind file after biological death, would we really be restoring ourselves? This is a question that we'll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today [2].

For instance, Arianna Huffington, CEO of Thrive Global, suggests that we need to learn how to "evict the obnoxious roommate in our heads" - that is, to quiet our racing thoughts and worries [5].

According to Ray Kurzweil, an American inventor and futurist, mind-reading technology could potentially "radically lengthen our lifespan" by allowing us to backup and restore our minds [2]. However, this raises important philosophical questions about the nature of identity and self. If we could restore our mind file after biological death, would we really be restoring ourselves? This is a question that we'll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today [2].

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also have significant implications for our personal relationships and social interactions. For instance, Arianna Huffington, CEO of Thrive Global, suggests that we need to learn how to "evict the obnoxious roommate in our heads" - that is, to quiet our racing thoughts and worries [5]. If we could read minds, we might be able to better understand each other's thoughts and feelings, potentially leading to more empathy and

According to Ray Kurzweil, an American inventor and futurist, mind-reading technology could potentially "radically lengthen our lifespan" by allowing us to backup and restore our minds [2]. However, this raises important philosophical questions about the nature of identity and self. If we could restore our mind file after biological death, would we really be restoring ourselves? This is a question that we'll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today [2].

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also have significant implications for our personal relationships and social interactions. For instance, Arianna Huffington, CEO of Thrive Global, suggests that we need to learn how to "evict the obnoxious roommate in our heads" - that is, to quiet our racing thoughts and worries [5]. If we could read minds, we might be able to better understand each other's thoughts and feelings, potentially leading to more empathy and compassion.

According to Ray Kurzweil, an American inventor and futurist, mind-reading technology could potentially "radically lengthen our lifespan" by allowing us to backup and restore our minds [2]. However, this raises important philosophical questions about the nature of identity and self. If we could restore our mind file after biological death, would we really be restoring ourselves? This is a question that we'll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today [2].

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also have significant implications for our personal relationships and social interactions. For instance, Arianna Huffington, CEO of Thrive Global, suggests that we need to learn how to "evict the obnoxious roommate in our heads" - that is, to quiet our racing thoughts and worries [5]. If we could read minds, we might be able to better understand each other's thoughts and feelings, potentially leading to more empathy and compassion. However, this could also lead to a loss of personal autonomy and privacy, as our thoughts and feelings would be open to scrutiny by others

2024-11-08 11:59:15,699: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on our society and individual relationships. According to Ray Kurzweil, an American inventor and futurist, mind-reading technology could potentially "radically lengthen our lifespan" by allowing us to backup and restore our minds [2]. However, this raises important philosophical questions about the nature of identity and self. If we could restore our mind file after biological death, would we really be restoring ourselves? This is a question that we'll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today [2].

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also have significant implications for our personal relationships and social interactions. For instance, Arianna Huffington, CEO of Thrive Global, suggests that we need to learn how to "evict the obnoxious roommate in our heads" - that is, to quiet our racing thoughts and worries [5]. If we could read minds, we might be able to better understand each other's thoughts and feelings, potentially leading to more empathy and compassion. However, this could also lead to a loss of personal autonomy and privacy, as our thoughts and feelings would be open to scrutiny by others.

Furthermore, the ability to read minds could also have significant implications for our moral choices and decision-making processes. As noted in a 1952 article on groupthink, the ability to abstract and analyze human nature could potentially lead to a kind of "moral

2024-11-08 11:59:16,121: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on our society and individual relationships. According to Ray Kurzweil, an American inventor and futurist, mind-reading technology could potentially "radically lengthen our lifespan" by allowing us to backup and restore our minds [2]. However, this raises important philosophical questions about the nature of identity and self. If we could restore our mind file after biological death, would we really be restoring ourselves? This is a question that we'll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today [2].

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also have significant implications for our personal relationships and social interactions. For instance, Arianna Huffington, CEO of Thrive Global, suggests that we need to learn how to "evict the obnoxious roommate in our heads" - that is, to quiet our racing thoughts and worries [5]. If we could read minds, we might be able to better understand each other's thoughts and feelings, potentially leading to more empathy and compassion. However, this could also lead to a loss of personal autonomy and privacy, as our thoughts and feelings would be open to scrutiny by others.

Furthermore, the ability to read minds could also have significant implications for our moral choices and decision-making processes. As noted in a 1952 article on groupthink, the ability to abstract and analyze human nature could potentially lead to a kind of "moral certainty" where we feel we have only one valid course of action before us [4]. However, this could also lead to a kind of

2024-11-08 11:59:16,273: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What would happen if we could read minds?

2024-11-08 11:59:16,273: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on our society and individual relationships. According to Ray Kurzweil, an American inventor and futurist, mind-reading technology could potentially "radically lengthen our lifespan" by allowing us to backup and restore our minds [2]. However, this raises important philosophical questions about the nature of identity and self. If we could restore our mind file after biological death, would we really be restoring ourselves? This is a question that we'll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today [2].

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also have significant implications for our personal relationships and social interactions. For instance, Arianna Huffington, CEO of Thrive Global, suggests that we need to learn how to "evict the obnoxious roommate in our heads" - that is, to quiet our racing thoughts and worries [5]. If we could read minds, we might be able to better understand each other's thoughts and feelings, potentially leading to more empathy and compassion. However, this could also lead to a loss of personal autonomy and privacy, as our thoughts and feelings would be open to scrutiny by others.

Furthermore, the ability to read minds could also have significant implications for our moral choices and decision-making processes. As noted in a 1952 article on groupthink, the ability to abstract and analyze human nature could potentially lead to a kind of "moral certainty" where we feel we have only one valid course of action before us [4]. However, this could also lead to a kind of "deification of group harmony" where we prioritize the needs

2024-11-08 11:59:16,516: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on our society and individual relationships. According to Ray Kurzweil, an American inventor and futurist, mind-reading technology could potentially "radically lengthen our lifespan" by allowing us to backup and restore our minds [2]. However, this raises important philosophical questions about the nature of identity and self. If we could restore our mind file after biological death, would we really be restoring ourselves? This is a question that we'll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today [2].

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also have significant implications for our personal relationships and social interactions. For instance, Arianna Huffington, CEO of Thrive Global, suggests that we need to learn how to "evict the obnoxious roommate in our heads" - that is, to quiet our racing thoughts and worries [5]. If we could read minds, we might be able to better understand each other's thoughts and feelings, potentially leading to more empathy and compassion. However, this could also lead to a loss of personal autonomy and privacy, as our thoughts and feelings would be open to scrutiny by others.

Furthermore, the ability to read minds could also have significant implications for our moral choices and decision-making processes. As noted in a 1952 article on groupthink, the ability to abstract and analyze human nature could potentially lead to a kind of "moral certainty" where we feel we have only one valid course of action before us [4]. However, this could also lead to a kind of "deification of group harmony" where we prioritize the needs of the group over individual moral choices.

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also have significant implications for our personal relationships and social interactions. For instance, Arianna Huffington, CEO of Thrive Global, suggests that we need to learn how to "evict the obnoxious roommate in our heads" - that is, to quiet our racing thoughts and worries [5]. If we could read minds, we might be able to better understand each other's thoughts and feelings, potentially leading to more empathy and compassion. However, this could also lead to a loss of personal autonomy and privacy, as our thoughts and feelings would be open to scrutiny by others.

Furthermore, the ability to read minds could also have significant implications for our moral choices and decision-making processes. As noted in a 1952 article on groupthink, the ability to abstract and analyze human nature could potentially lead to a kind of "moral certainty" where we feel we have only one valid course of action before us [4]. However, this could also lead to a kind of "deification of group harmony" where we prioritize the needs of the group over individual moral choices. Ultimately, the implications of mind-reading technology would depend on how we choose to use it and the values we bring to its development

2024-11-08 11:59:16,728: ObserveEventsHandler(  206): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd last message: What would happen if we could read minds?

2024-11-08 11:59:16,728: ObserveEventsHandler(  207): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on our society and individual relationships. According to Ray Kurzweil, an American inventor and futurist, mind-reading technology could potentially "radically lengthen our lifespan" by allowing us to backup and restore our minds [2]. However, this raises important philosophical questions about the nature of identity and self. If we could restore our mind file after biological death, would we really be restoring ourselves? This is a question that we'll have to grapple with during the lifetimes of most people already alive today [2].

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also have significant implications for our personal relationships and social interactions. For instance, Arianna Huffington, CEO of Thrive Global, suggests that we need to learn how to "evict the obnoxious roommate in our heads" - that is, to quiet our racing thoughts and worries [5]. If we could read minds, we might be able to better understand each other's thoughts and feelings, potentially leading to more empathy and compassion. However, this could also lead to a loss of personal autonomy and privacy, as our thoughts and feelings would be open to scrutiny by others.

Furthermore, the ability to read minds could also have significant implications for our moral choices and decision-making processes. As noted in a 1952 article on groupthink, the ability to abstract and analyze human nature could potentially lead to a kind of "moral certainty" where we feel we have only one valid course of action before us [4]. However, this could also lead to a kind of "deification of group harmony" where we prioritize the needs of the group over individual moral choices. Ultimately, the implications of mind-reading technology would depend on how we choose to use it and the values we bring to its development and deployment.
