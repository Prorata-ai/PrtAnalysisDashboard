Deadpool & Wolverine is scheduled to be released in the US in July.\n\nAnother franchise Disney acquired as part of the Fox deal was Avatar. The second film, released in 2022, was also cleared by Chinese regulators and became the third-highest-grossing movie in history, with $2.3 billion in ticket sales. \n\nOn June 14, Disney released Inside Out 2, generating a $295 million global haul in ticket sales that scored the biggest opening weekend in history for an animated film.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/17/marvel-deadpool-movie-china-release-disney-box-office-earnings/\n\nSource 4:\nThe year-to-date gap between box office performance this year and last is getting moderately slimmer.

However, they do not specify which film was the top-grossing film of 2023.

I can tell you that the summer box office in 2023 was mentioned to have reached $4 billion [2], but the sources do not provide a breakdown of the top-grossing films for that year. If you're looking for information on the top-grossing films of 2024, I'd be happy to provide that information.

It's worth noting that the sources do mention the success of "Barbenheimer" in 2023, which refers to the combined box office performance of "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" [1]. However, it's not clear if either of these films was the top-grossing film of 2023.
