None of the other grandees of American business—not Jack Welch, not Warren Buffett, not Steve Jobs, not Ted Turner—even come close. This embarrassing state of affairs might be likened to the time when Betty Crocker polled as the second-most-admired woman in America (behind Eleanor Roosevelt, who had the advantage of being a real person) or when kids voted Hulk Hogan their favorite athlete a few years back. For Donald Trump is to business what professional wrestling is to sports: part of it, certainly, but also a cartoonish parody of it.

These included some glossy brochures and a copy of New York Construction News, which, it seemed, had named Trump owner and developer of the year for 1999. "Owner and developer of the year," he pointed out with his uncommonly stubby fingers, "which is unusual." It was early January, and the plane was headed for Minnesota, where Trump was to meet with Governor Jesse Ventura to discuss running for President on the Reform Party ticket. Onboard were a handful of journalists, Trump\'s son Donny Jr., and his political adviser, Roger Stone, a former Nixon and Reagan handler who favors three-piece pinstriped suits and a pocket watch. Also onboard were some gold-plated sinks, a double bed, and gilt-framed works of art with signatures like "Renoir." Nobody I asked seemed to know if they were real, or to care.

"Because I\'ve been successful, make money, get headlines, and have authored bestselling books," he wrote in his new book, "I have a better chance to make my ideas public than do people who are less well known."

"I\'ve brought some things for you," he said, handing me a sheaf of papers as he boarded his private 727. These included some glossy brochures and a copy of New York Construction News, which, it seemed, had named Trump owner and developer of the year for 1999. "Owner and developer of the year," he pointed out with his uncommonly stubby fingers, "which is unusual." It was early January, and the plane was headed for Minnesota, where Trump was to meet with Governor Jesse Ventura to discuss running for President on the Reform Party ticket. Onboard were a handful of journalists, Trump\'s son Donny Jr., and his political adviser, Roger Stone, a former Nixon and Reagan handler who favors three-piece pinstriped suits and a pocket watch. Also onboard were some gold-plated sinks, a double bed, and gilt-framed works of art with signatures like "Renoir." Nobody I asked seemed to know if they were real, or to care.

"Owner and developer of the year," he pointed out with his uncommonly stubby fingers, "which is unusual." It was early January, and the plane was headed for Minnesota, where Trump was to meet with Governor Jesse Ventura to discuss running for President on the Reform Party ticket. Onboard were a handful of journalists, Trump\'s son Donny Jr., and his political adviser, Roger Stone, a former Nixon and Reagan handler who favors three-piece pinstriped suits and a pocket watch.

In front of me sat Donald Trump. He was wearing a blue suit, cuff links, and one of his famous red ties; his hair, as usual, seemed to be levitating slightly above his skull in a baroque swirl. "People liked the speech," Trump began. "You even liked it, I heard. Did you like my speech?"

If that sounds far-fetched, it may be because you haven\'t yet grasped the governing principles of the Trumpian universe. Consider, for instance, his beef with America\'s trade representatives: It\'s that they have low name recognition. "Who are these people?" Trump sputtered at one point.

But the real puzzler is what, exactly, Donald Trump wants. As we walked through the half-gutted lobby of the General Motors <https://fortune.com/company/general-motors/> Building, Trump insisted he most wanted to be respected as a builder. "The thing I do best is I build," he said. "Everyone says, \'Oh, Trump is a great promoter.\' I don\'t think I\'m even a good promoter. You build a great product, it becomes successful." He paused to touch some tiny bronze fixtures. "See, these were all corroded—they looked disgusting," he said. "Now it\'s great, right?" But even while Trump complains he\'d like to be covered "more in business and less in social," he can\'t seem to help himself. In the end, one is simply humbled before the awesome insularity of his logic.

Is he a real phony or just a regular phony? Martin Balsam\'s question, originally applied to Holly Golightly, is just as central here. It is also appropriate: Trump, after all, is the man who purchased Tiffany\'s air rights to clear the way for a monument to himself, Trump Tower, and thereupon replaced Holly as the most famous social climber ever to hang out at 57th and Fifth. But before examining that question, let us first pose another: Why all the current fascination with Donald Trump?\nHe is only the 27th-largest developer in the U.S., according to Building Design and Construction magazine, and is not even the biggest in New York. He has built only three buildings in Manhattan; dozens of other developers have exerted more influence on Gotham\'s skyline. As a corporate shark, the Great White Yuppie draws yawns on Wall Street. A takeover lawyer told Fortune (September 28): "I haven\'t the slightest idea what he\'s doing. He\'s in and out, in and out. It\'s hard to separate the man from the publicity." He is certainly not the billionaire he claims he is, not by Fortune’s reckoning (or Forbes’s).\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/donald-trump-explained-january-1988/\n\nSource 3:\nDonald Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States on Wednesday, an extraordinary comeback for a former president who refused to accept defeat four years ago, sparked a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, was convicted of felony charges and survived two assassination attempts.\n\nWith a win in Wisconsin, Trump cleared the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidency.\n\nThe victory validates his bare-knuckle approach to politics. He attacked his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in deeply personal – often misogynistic and racist – terms as he pushed an apocalyptic picture of a country overrun by violent migrants. The coarse rhetoric, paired with an image of hypermasculinity, resonated with angry voters – particularly men – in a deeply polarized nation.\n\nAs president, he’s vowed to pursue an agenda centered on dramatically reshaping the federal government and pursuing retribution against his perceived enemies. Speaking to his supporters Wednesday morning, Trump claimed he had won “an unprecedented and powerful mandate.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/11/06/us-election-result-donald-trump-wins/\n\nSource 4:\nFormer President Donald Trump is pulling ahead <https://fortune.com/2024/10/19/who-will-win-the-presidential-election-poll-trump-media-stock-bitcoin-dollar/> in the polls as the presidential election <https://fortune.com/2024/10/22/trump-musk-harris-election-presidency-polymarket-crypto/> enters its home stretch. \n\nA number of news outlets <https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/10/21/why-donald-trump-has-moved-ahead-in-our-election-forecast> and election forecasters <https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4939442-trump-harris-nate-silver-model/> showed Trump overtaking Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/22/donald-trump-ahead-polls-excitements-over-for-kamala-harris/\n\nSource 5:\nDonald Trump can seem at times like a caricature of himself, and yet he\'s strangely appealing. He has a warm side—on the flight he cooed over Knauss\'s sore throat—and a politician\'s knack for making it seem as if he\'s telling you something for the first time he\'s said many times before. Even his constant, casual mentions of how much he makes, how much the things he owns cost, and how much he has in the bank are somehow refreshing. He\'s not embarrassed about making money or spending it. And the best way to understand how Trump makes it is to see how he lost it.\nHe\'s like P.T. Barnum on steroids. He\'s a skillful marketing person, and what he markets is his name."\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/donald-trump-business-enterprise/\n\nSource 6:\n1, because I\'m Trump." This is business done the Donald Trump way. Don\'t believe what you see on TV--watching him work is actually much more entertaining. In Trump\'s reality show, The Apprentice, he and two lieutenants monitor contestants as they backstab their way to a $250,000-a-year job as president of one of his companies. In Trump\'s real life he has managed--by force of personality, insane attention to certain details, charisma, bluntness, self-promotion, and connections--to build an empire of steel, marble, beauty pageants, casinos, and some of the most incredible moldings you\'ll ever see. The total value? If you believe Trump, $6 billion. But few people actually believe him. And there\'s good reason. Trump is the Reality Tycoon. He lives his life straight out of the Survivor handbook: Start with the truth, then add enough drama, celebrity, sex, and what might very charitably be called creative editing to make something entirely outlandish. What The Bachelor is to dating and American Idol is to singing in the shower, Trump is to business. He dabbles in the world of management and money as we know it: working through deals, meeting\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-trophy-life-fortune-classics-2004/'}

In front of me sat Donald Trump. He was wearing a blue suit, cuff links, and one of his famous red ties; his hair, as usual, seemed to be levitating slightly above his skull in a baroque swirl. "People liked the speech," Trump began. "You even liked it, I heard. Did you like my speech?"

But it all raised the question: Just how successful a businessman is he?\nA couple of weeks after the Minnesota trip I was sitting in the Trump Tower offices of the Trump Organization, surrounded by magazine covers featuring Donald Trump and flanked by two of Trump\'s lieutenants. In front of me sat Donald Trump. He was wearing a blue suit, cuff links, and one of his famous red ties; his hair, as usual, seemed to be levitating slightly above his skull in a baroque swirl. "People liked the speech," Trump began. "You even liked it, I heard. Did you like my speech?" I mumbled something polite, then turned the conversation to the task at hand: figuring out what Trump\'s empire actually consisted of.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-does-donald-trump-really-want/\n\nSource 1:\nRight or wrong, his presidential dalliance had generated coverage and then some; Trump recounted how Don King, the furious-haired boxing promoter, called up to declare, "This is the single greatest promotion I have ever seen!" It was widely presumed, of course, that Trump\'s political noodlings were just that: a promotion, a cynical ploy to sell books and condos—politics as the continuation of salesmanship by other means, if you will. But after spending time with Trump over several weeks, I became convinced otherwise. The man seriously wanted to seek the American presidency—to win, as he put it, "the whole megillah." If that sounds far-fetched, it may be because you haven\'t yet grasped the governing principles of the Trumpian universe. Consider, for instance, his beef with America\'s trade representatives: It\'s that they have low name recognition. "Who are these people?" Trump sputtered at one point. "Nobody\'s ever heard of them!" As for candidates who had made less money than he: "They\'re losers. Who the hell wants to have a person like this for President?" More famous, more money: To those who objected that he had no obvious qualifications for politics other than a Bob Dole-like tendency\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-does-donald-trump-really-want/\n\nSource 1:\nperhaps wasn\'t so much egotistical as medical. I even called a psychiatrist to get his clinical assessment of Trump. (He suggested an overmastering need to escape the shadow of his father, Fred, a successful outer-borough developer who died last year and whom Trump rarely mentions.) But the real puzzler is what, exactly, Donald Trump wants. As we walked through the half-gutted lobby of the General Motors <https://fortune.com/company/general-motors/> Building, Trump insisted he most wanted to be respected as a builder. "The thing I do best is I build," he said. "Everyone says, \'Oh, Trump is a great promoter.\' I don\'t think I\'m even a good promoter. You build a great product, it becomes successful." He paused to touch some tiny bronze fixtures. "See, these were all corroded—they looked disgusting," he said. "Now it\'s great, right?" But even while Trump complains he\'d like to be covered "more in business and less in social," he can\'t seem to help himself. In the end, one is simply humbled before the awesome insularity of his logic. "I own a lot of things that I don\'t have my name on," he explained at one\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-does-donald-trump-really-want/\n\nSource 2:\ntold the Wall Street Journal, "they\'ll make a fortune by reading this book." Yes, they will—for Donald Trump. This article was originally published in the January 4, 1988 issue of Fortune.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/article/donald-trump-explained-january-1988/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/donald-trump-explained-january-1988/\n\nSource 2:\nthe makeup of Donald Trump: the pomposity, the shallowness, and above all, the need for more money, more toys, and more attention. Is he a real phony or just a regular phony? Martin Balsam\'s question, originally applied to Holly Golightly, is just as central here. It is also appropriate: Trump, after all, is the man who purchased Tiffany\'s air rights to clear the way for a monument to himself, Trump Tower, and thereupon replaced Holly as the most famous social climber ever to hang out at 57th and Fifth. But before examining that question, let us first pose another: Why all the current fascination with Donald Trump?\nHe is only the 27th-largest developer in the U.S., according to Building Design and Construction magazine, and is not even the biggest in New York. He has built only three buildings in Manhattan; dozens of other developers have exerted more influence on Gotham\'s skyline. As a corporate shark, the Great White Yuppie draws yawns on Wall Street. A takeover lawyer told Fortune (September 28): "I haven\'t the slightest idea what he\'s doing. He\'s in and out, in and out. It\'s hard to separate the man from the publicity." He is certainly not the billionaire he claims he is, not by Fortune’s reckoning (or Forbes’s).\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/donald-trump-explained-january-1988/\n\nSource 3:\nDonald Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States on Wednesday, an extraordinary comeback for a former president who refused to accept defeat four years ago, sparked a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, was convicted of felony charges and survived two assassination attempts.\n\nWith a win in Wisconsin, Trump cleared the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidency.\n\nThe victory validates his bare-knuckle approach to politics. He attacked his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in deeply personal – often misogynistic and racist – terms as he pushed an apocalyptic picture of a country overrun by violent migrants. The coarse rhetoric, paired with an image of hypermasculinity, resonated with angry voters – particularly men – in a deeply polarized nation.\n\nAs president, he’s vowed to pursue an agenda centered on dramatically reshaping the federal government and pursuing retribution against his perceived enemies. Speaking to his supporters Wednesday morning, Trump claimed he had won “an unprecedented and powerful mandate.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/11/06/us-election-result-donald-trump-wins/\n\nSource 4:\nFormer President Donald Trump is pulling ahead <https://fortune.com/2024/10/19/who-will-win-the-presidential-election-poll-trump-media-stock-bitcoin-dollar/> in the polls as the presidential election <https://fortune.com/2024/10/22/trump-musk-harris-election-presidency-polymarket-crypto/> enters its home stretch. \n\nA number of news outlets <https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/10/21/why-donald-trump-has-moved-ahead-in-our-election-forecast> and election forecasters <https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4939442-trump-harris-nate-silver-model/> showed Trump overtaking Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/22/donald-trump-ahead-polls-excitements-over-for-kamala-harris/\n\nSource 5:\nDonald Trump can seem at times like a caricature of himself, and yet he\'s strangely appealing. He has a warm side—on the flight he cooed over Knauss\'s sore throat—and a politician\'s knack for making it seem as if he\'s telling you something for the first time he\'s said many times before. Even his constant, casual mentions of how much he makes, how much the things he owns cost, and how much he has in the bank are somehow refreshing. He\'s not embarrassed about making money or spending it. And the best way to understand how Trump makes it is to see how he lost it.\nHe\'s like P.T. Barnum on steroids. He\'s a skillful marketing person, and what he markets is his name."\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/donald-trump-business-enterprise/\n\nSource 6:\n1, because I\'m Trump." This is business done the Donald Trump way. Don\'t believe what you see on TV--watching him work is actually much more entertaining. In Trump\'s reality show, The Apprentice, he and two lieutenants monitor contestants as they backstab their way to a $250,000-a-year job as president of one of his companies. In Trump\'s real life he has managed--by force of personality, insane attention to certain details, charisma, bluntness, self-promotion, and connections--to build an empire of steel, marble, beauty pageants, casinos, and some of the most incredible moldings you\'ll ever see. The total value? If you believe Trump, $6 billion. But few people actually believe him. And there\'s good reason. Trump is the Reality Tycoon. He lives his life straight out of the Survivor handbook: Start with the truth, then add enough drama, celebrity, sex, and what might very charitably be called creative editing to make something entirely outlandish. What The Bachelor is to dating and American Idol is to singing in the shower, Trump is to business. He dabbles in the world of management and money as we know it: working through deals, meeting\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-trophy-life-fortune-classics-2004/'}

2024-11-08 11:56:07,741: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Donald Trump is a well-known American businessman and politician. According to Fortune, at age 53, he was possibly the most famous businessman in America, with 98% of Americans knowing who he is [1]. He has been a prominent figure in American business and politics for several decades, and his celebrity status has been likened to a "cartoonish parody" of business, much like professional wrestling is to sports [1]. Trump's business empire includes a range of ventures, from real estate development to beauty pageants and casinos [5].

Despite his fame, Trump's business acumen has been questioned by some. He has been described as a " Reality Tycoon" who lives his life like a reality TV show, adding drama and celebrity to his business dealings [6]. His net worth has been estimated to be around $6 billion, although few people believe this figure to be accurate [6]. Trump has also been known for his self-promotion and need for attention, which has led some to speculate about his motivations and qualifications for politics [1].

According to Fortune, at age 53, he was possibly the most famous businessman in America, with 98% of Americans knowing who he is [1]. He has been a prominent figure in American business and politics for several decades, and his celebrity status has been likened to a "cartoonish parody" of business, much like professional wrestling is to sports [1]. Trump's business empire includes a range of ventures, from real estate development to beauty pageants and casinos [5].

Despite his fame, Trump's business acumen has been questioned by some.

His net worth has been estimated to be around $6 billion, although few people believe this figure to be accurate [6]. Trump has also been known for his self-promotion and need for attention, which has led some to speculate about his motivations and qualifications for politics [1].

2024-11-08 11:56:09,216: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Donald Trump is a well-known American businessman and politician. According to Fortune, at age 53, he was possibly the most famous businessman in America, with 98% of Americans knowing who he is [1]. He has been a prominent figure in American business and politics for several decades, and his celebrity status has been likened to a "cartoonish parody" of business, much like professional wrestling is to sports [1]. Trump's business empire includes a range of ventures, from real estate development to beauty pageants and casinos [5].

Despite his fame, Trump's business acumen has been questioned by some. He has been described as a " Reality Tycoon" who lives his life like a reality TV show, adding drama and celebrity to his business dealings [6]. His net worth has been estimated to be around $6 billion, although few people believe this figure to be accurate [6]. Trump has also been known for his self-promotion and need for attention, which has led some to speculate about his motivations and qualifications for politics [1].

In addition to his business ventures, Trump has also pursued a career in politics. He was elected as the 47th President of the United States in a surprise comeback, despite having been convicted of felony charges and surviving two assassination attempts [3]. His presidential campaign was marked by controversy and divisive rhetoric, which resonated with some voters but alienated others [3].
