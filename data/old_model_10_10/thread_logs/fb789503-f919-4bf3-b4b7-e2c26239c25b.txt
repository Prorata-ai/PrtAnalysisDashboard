But I wanted to highlight this option nonetheless to show just how much value Qantas is willing to give you for your Membership Rewards Points—and point out that a wombat-filled Aussie adventure could be well within your financial reach. \n\nThe takeaway\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/recommends/credit-cards/dream-trips-100000-amex-membership-rewards-points/\n\nSource 4:\nThat’s not the only problem. Some of the country’s watchdogs are either short of resources, have few corporate scalps to their name, or dish out fines that do little to deter bad behavior. Star Entertainment Group Ltd. was this month fined just A$15 million—less than 1% of revenue—by its regulator after an inquiry found the casino operator had breached its license several times and was unfit to run its flagship Sydney complex, despite having had two years <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-13/star-entertainment-found-unsuitable-to-run-sydney-casino> to address its problems. \n\nThe head of a Senate inquiry into the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the country’s primary corporate regulator, in July described the agency <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-13/star-entertainment-found-unsuitable-to-run-sydney-casino> as “an organization without transparency, few prosecutions, and a litany of cultural, structural and governance issues.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/10/23/billionaire-sex-saga-latest-scandal-australia-ceo-wisetech-richard-white/\n\nSource 5:\nIn search of greener pastures\n\nPeople choose to move to Down Under because of its warm weather, low visa barrier and English fluency, among other reasons. Besides lifestyle reasons, Australia has also ranked among the top countries for highly skilled talent <https://www.insead.edu/system/files/2023-11/gtci-2023-report.pdf> in past studies, thanks to its job opportunities. The country has risen from seventh in BCG’s list to first in 10 years.\n\nThe findings come at a time when the U.K. and Australia are overhauling <https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-67609963> their immigration system to tighten the criteria for those looking to enter the country. Britain has seen its fair share of struggles attracting inter-Europe talent following Brexit. \n\nHowever, labor shortages pose a real threat, which immigration helps address. In 2022, the U.K. had a record surge in arrivals <https://reuters.com/world/uk/net-migration-uk-hits-record-606000-2022-2023-05-25/> amid global conflicts and a talent shortfall.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/04/24/london-international-talent-magnet-amsterdam-new-york-dubai-australia-bcg-report/\n\nSource 6:\nEither way, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is likely satisfied on this Australian winter day. \n\n“What we are simply saying is that someone who isn’t being paid 24 hours a day shouldn’t be penalized if they’re not online and available 24 hours a day,” he said back in February <https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/08/business/australia-workers-ignore-after-hours-calls-intl-scli/index.html>.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/08/26/australia-right-to-disconnect-law-violation-fine-13000-after-hours/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/26/australia-right-to-disconnect-law-violation-fine-13000-after-hours/\n\nSource 6:\nAustralia is instituting no-contact rules with your manager, and will impose stiff penalties on violators.\n\nEarlier this year <https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/world/australia/right-to-disconnect-law.html>, the country introduced legislation that gave workers what many pine for: the ability to ignore their boss after clocking out. \n\nThe law, which was passed in February and came into effect on Monday, covers what is otherwise known as “the right to disconnect.” Now, millions of Aussie workers’ phones might as well be swimming with the weird overgrown Australian fishes when they unplug. In this newly unveiled workforce <https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-employees-now-have-right-ignore-work-emails-calls-after-hours-2024-08-25/> landscape, most employees can’t be punished for not responding to their bosses outside of their hours.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/26/australia-right-to-disconnect-law-violation-fine-13000-after-hours/\n\nSource 7:\nAustralia’s opposition has promised even stricter limits, without specifying its policy proposals. Australian voters are due to go to the polls by May 2025 with sentiment swinging against rapid immigration — a survey in May showed 66% of respondents said 2023’s migrant intake “was too high” <https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/voters-favour-deeper-cuts-to-migration-as-labor-misses-budget-boost-20240517-p5jejd.html> with 50% wanting the government to make deeper cuts to immigration. \n\nA parliamentary inquiry into the proposed legislation is due to report back by Thursday. Given the proposed legislation has bipartisan support, analysts expect it to pass parliament this year, though universities might yet be able to persuade the government to water down some proposals.\n\n“Migration is shaping up as a key battlefront in the lead-up to the federal election and the university sector is shaping up to be the fall guy,” Vicki Thomson <https://go8.edu.au/about/team>, chief executive of the Group of Eight, said in her opening statement to a parliamentary hearing reviewing the proposed legislation on Aug. 6. “This rushed and poorly framed legislation is a classic example of retrofitting policy to suit dubious politics.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/17/u-k-government-is-targetting-international-students-to-rein-in-surging-immigration-and-its-working/'}

2024-11-08 12:05:40,948: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The capital of Australia is Canberra. This is mentioned in Source 1, where it is stated that Chinese Premier Li Qiang met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in Canberra during his four-day visit to Australia [1]. Canberra is also implied to be the capital in Source 6, where it is mentioned that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese made a statement about the "right to disconnect" law, although the city is not explicitly mentioned in this source. However, based on the information provided in Source 1, we can confirm that Canberra is indeed the capital of Australia [1].
