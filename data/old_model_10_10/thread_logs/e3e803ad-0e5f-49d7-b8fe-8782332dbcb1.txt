ChatGPT changed that. Suddenly everyone is talking about how A.I. might upend their jobs, companies, schools, and lives.\n\nChatGPT is part of a wave of related A.I. technologies collectively known as “generative A.I.”—one that also includes buzzy art generators like Midjourney and Lensa. And OpenAI’s position at the forefront of the tech industry’s next big thing has the hallmarks of a startup epic, including an all-star cast of characters and an investor frenzy that has crowned it with a reported valuation of $29 billion.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/longform/chatgpt-openai-sam-altman-microsoft/\n\nSource 4:\nDon’t get me wrong—I’m no Debbie Downer about AI. It will be hugely transformative for business, from handling back-office chores to taking notes for doctors when they see patients. But I’m also a realist. Most companies are still in the very early stages of deploying the technology and wider rollouts will take time, especially considering the very real risks of hallucinations and inaccuracies. Most of the promised financial benefits—the workforce synergies, to cite one corporate euphemism—will likely come much further down the road.\n\nSure, there are a handful of exceptions, mostly involving companies selling the basic tools that customers need to deploy AI. Those obvious winners include chipmaker Nvidia <https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/> and big cloud service providers Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, although they’re also having to invest huge amounts of money to expand their data centers to keep up with demand.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/26/ai-spending-stocks-market-nasdaq-wall-street-alphabet-microsoft-amazon-meta/\n\nSource 5:\nAt its core, artificial intelligence empowers machines to perform tasks previously thought to require human intelligence. The technology has existed in early versions for decades, having emerged with a problem-solving computer program, the Logic Theorist, built in the 1950s at what's now Carnegie Mellon University. More recently, think of voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. Or IBM’s chess-playing computer, Deep Blue, which managed to beat the world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.\n\nAI really burst into public consciousness in 2022, when OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, the generative AI tool that can conduct conversations, write computer code, compose music, craft essays and supply endless streams of information. The arrival of generative AI has raised worries that chatbots will replace freelance writers, editors, coders, telemarketers, customer-service reps, paralegals and many more.\n\n“AI is going to eliminate a lot of current jobs, and this is going to change the way that a lot of current jobs function,'' Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said in a discussion at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in May.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/02/ai-change-job-eliminate-many-labor-experts-say/\n\nSource 6:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/06/20/ai-democratizes-technology-reshaping-industries/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/20/ai-democratizes-technology-reshaping-industries/\n\nSource 7:\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/aviation-ai-airports-technology-airlines-air-travel/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/aviation-ai-airports-technology-airlines-air-travel/\n\nSource 8:\nAI—no, not artificial intelligence; Apple <https://fortune.com/company/apple/> Intelligence™—was the focal point of Apple’s keynote presentation for its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday.

You’ll need the latest Apple devices to actually enjoy Apple Intelligence. And it’s exactly what Tim Cook and Co. have needed to get people interested in new iPhones again.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/11/apple-intelligence-iphone-supported-devices-wwdc-siri-tim-cook/\n\nSource 9:\nIt seems as if AI mania is all around us. Mainstream media is discussing its many uses. Congress is debating its merits. Companies are announcing significant investments and touting its benefits, while others are more closely evaluating its ethics. \n\nWe’re at an inflection point in AI’s history, but AI isn’t actually new. It’s been around for decades in forms like machine learning and natural language processing. What’s changing the game today is powerful advances in generative AI trained on massive large language models.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2023/11/30/everfi-ai-for-good/\n\nSource 10:\nWhen CEOs talk to investors about layoffs <https://fortune.com/tag/layoffs/>, they usually blame economic uncertainty or business “headwinds. <https://fortune.com/2023/11/09/virtual-event-purpose-driven-leadership-deloitte/>” Now a new term is starting to crop up in these announcements: AI.\nIn recent months, shipping giant UPS announced plans to cut 12,000 office jobs <https://fortune.com/2024/01/30/ups-layoffs-12000-management-union-contract/> that CEO Carol Tomé <https://fortune.com/ranking/most-powerful-women/2023/carol-tome/> said were unlikely to return because the company was increasingly using AI <https://fortune.com/tag/eye-on-a-i/> to automate tasks these workers performed. Meanwhile, financial giant BlackRock <https://fortune.com/company/blackrock/> said it would eliminate about 600 positions <https://fortune.com/2024/01/09/blackrock-layoffs-job-cuts-600-larry-fink-profound-changes-new-technologies/>, couching the cuts as an effort to prepare for coming shifts in the asset management industry, of which AI is among several drivers. Then there was Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/>, which recently laid off <https://fortune.com/2024/01/20/google-amazon-tech-layoffs-reasons-4-worrying-trends/> ad-sales staff partly because new AI tools were helping customers manage ad campaigns themselves.

Generative AI combined with other digital technologies could add between 0.5 to 3.4 percentage points annually to productivity growth, equivalent to between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion, according to McKinsey <https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights>. The IMF <https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity> estimates that AI will affect almost 40% of jobs globally and up to 60% of jobs in advanced economies.\n\nAI is the headline technology, but the two supporting acts are just as important. Data crunching is the fuel that powers the Generative AI engine, whose processing power can only be delivered through cloud computing and networks—5G and fiber broadband networks today, with 6G coming into the mix from around 2030.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/07/16/nokia-ceo-europe-innovation-champions-tech-politics/"}

Or IBM’s chess-playing computer, Deep Blue, which managed to beat the world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.\n\nAI really burst into public consciousness in 2022, when OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, the generative AI tool that can conduct conversations, write computer code, compose music, craft essays and supply endless streams of information. The arrival of generative AI has raised worries that chatbots will replace freelance writers, editors, coders, telemarketers, customer-service reps, paralegals and many more.\n\n“AI is going to eliminate a lot of current jobs, and this is going to change the way that a lot of current jobs function,'' Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said in a discussion at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in May.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/02/ai-change-job-eliminate-many-labor-experts-say/\n\nSource 6:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/06/20/ai-democratizes-technology-reshaping-industries/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/20/ai-democratizes-technology-reshaping-industries/\n\nSource 7:\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/aviation-ai-airports-technology-airlines-air-travel/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/aviation-ai-airports-technology-airlines-air-travel/\n\nSource 8:\nAI—no, not artificial intelligence; Apple <https://fortune.com/company/apple/> Intelligence™—was the focal point of Apple’s keynote presentation for its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday. The 100-minute program was jam-packed with announcements <https://fortune.com/2024/06/10/apple-wwdc-2024-keynote-biggest-announcements-intelligence-siri-iphone-ios-mac-ipad-watch/>, but Apple Intelligence <https://fortune.com/2024/05/29/apple-once-in-a-decade-secret-weapon-ai-intelliphones-bank-of-america-says-stock-surge/> and the company’s long-awaited upgrades to Siri, which has been a laughingstock among virtual assistants for the better part of the past decade-plus, stole the show <https://fortune.com/2024/06/10/apple-wwdc-announcements-make-ai-comfortable-for-normies/>.\n\nThe catch? You’ll need the latest Apple devices to actually enjoy Apple Intelligence. And it’s exactly what Tim Cook and Co. have needed to get people interested in new iPhones again.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/11/apple-intelligence-iphone-supported-devices-wwdc-siri-tim-cook/\n\nSource 9:\nIt seems as if AI mania is all around us. Mainstream media is discussing its many uses. Congress is debating its merits. Companies are announcing significant investments and touting its benefits, while others are more closely evaluating its ethics. \n\nWe’re at an inflection point in AI’s history, but AI isn’t actually new. It’s been around for decades in forms like machine learning and natural language processing. What’s changing the game today is powerful advances in generative AI trained on massive large language models.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2023/11/30/everfi-ai-for-good/\n\nSource 10:\nWhen CEOs talk to investors about layoffs <https://fortune.com/tag/layoffs/>, they usually blame economic uncertainty or business “headwinds. <https://fortune.com/2023/11/09/virtual-event-purpose-driven-leadership-deloitte/>” Now a new term is starting to crop up in these announcements: AI.\nIn recent months, shipping giant UPS announced plans to cut 12,000 office jobs <https://fortune.com/2024/01/30/ups-layoffs-12000-management-union-contract/> that CEO Carol Tomé <https://fortune.com/ranking/most-powerful-women/2023/carol-tome/> said were unlikely to return because the company was increasingly using AI <https://fortune.com/tag/eye-on-a-i/> to automate tasks these workers performed. Meanwhile, financial giant BlackRock <https://fortune.com/company/blackrock/> said it would eliminate about 600 positions <https://fortune.com/2024/01/09/blackrock-layoffs-job-cuts-600-larry-fink-profound-changes-new-technologies/>, couching the cuts as an effort to prepare for coming shifts in the asset management industry, of which AI is among several drivers. Then there was Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/>, which recently laid off <https://fortune.com/2024/01/20/google-amazon-tech-layoffs-reasons-4-worrying-trends/> ad-sales staff partly because new AI tools were helping customers manage ad campaigns themselves.

Generative AI combined with other digital technologies could add between 0.5 to 3.4 percentage points annually to productivity growth, equivalent to between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion, according to McKinsey <https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights>. The IMF <https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity> estimates that AI will affect almost 40% of jobs globally and up to 60% of jobs in advanced economies.\n\nAI is the headline technology, but the two supporting acts are just as important. Data crunching is the fuel that powers the Generative AI engine, whose processing power can only be delivered through cloud computing and networks—5G and fiber broadband networks today, with 6G coming into the mix from around 2030.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/07/16/nokia-ceo-europe-innovation-champions-tech-politics/"}

2024-11-08 11:46:24,584: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: In the context of technology, "AI" stands for Artificial Intelligence [5]. This refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making [5]. The term has been around for decades, with early versions of AI emerging in the 1950s, such as the Logic Theorist, a problem-solving computer program developed at what is now Carnegie Mellon University [5].

Artificial Intelligence has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly with the introduction of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, which can conduct conversations, write computer code, compose music, and craft essays [3]. This has raised concerns about the potential impact of AI on jobs, with some experts predicting that it could eliminate a significant number of current jobs and change the way many others function [5].

2024-11-08 11:46:24,832: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: In the context of technology, "AI" stands for Artificial Intelligence [5]. This refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making [5]. The term has been around for decades, with early versions of AI emerging in the 1950s, such as the Logic Theorist, a problem-solving computer program developed at what is now Carnegie Mellon University [5].

Artificial Intelligence has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly with the introduction of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, which can conduct conversations, write computer code, compose music, and craft essays [3]. This has raised concerns about the potential impact of AI on jobs, with some experts predicting that it could eliminate a significant number of current jobs and change the way many others function [5]. According to Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, "AI is going to eliminate a lot of current jobs, and this is going to change the way that a lot of current jobs function" [5].

2024-11-08 11:46:26,341: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: In the context of technology, "AI" stands for Artificial Intelligence [5]. This refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making [5]. The term has been around for decades, with early versions of AI emerging in the 1950s, such as the Logic Theorist, a problem-solving computer program developed at what is now Carnegie Mellon University [5].

Artificial Intelligence has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly with the introduction of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, which can conduct conversations, write computer code, compose music, and craft essays [3]. This has raised concerns about the potential impact of AI on jobs, with some experts predicting that it could eliminate a significant number of current jobs and change the way many others function [5]. According to Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, "AI is going to eliminate a lot of current jobs, and this is going to change the way that a lot of current jobs function" [5].

2024-11-08 11:46:26,974: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: In the context of technology, "AI" stands for Artificial Intelligence [5]. This refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making [5]. The term has been around for decades, with early versions of AI emerging in the 1950s, such as the Logic Theorist, a problem-solving computer program developed at what is now Carnegie Mellon University [5].

Artificial Intelligence has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly with the introduction of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, which can conduct conversations, write computer code, compose music, and craft essays [3]. This has raised concerns about the potential impact of AI on jobs, with some experts predicting that it could eliminate a significant number of current jobs and change the way many others function [5]. According to Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, "AI is going to eliminate a lot of current jobs, and this is going to change the way that a lot of current jobs function" [5].

The development and deployment of AI technology are being driven by significant investments from big tech companies, with Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon being among the leaders in this space [4]. These companies are investing heavily in AI research and

2024-11-08 11:46:27,249: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: In the context of technology, "AI" stands for Artificial Intelligence [5]. This refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making [5]. The term has been around for decades, with early versions of AI emerging in the 1950s, such as the Logic Theorist, a problem-solving computer program developed at what is now Carnegie Mellon University [5].

Artificial Intelligence has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly with the introduction of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, which can conduct conversations, write computer code, compose music, and craft essays [3]. This has raised concerns about the potential impact of AI on jobs, with some experts predicting that it could eliminate a significant number of current jobs and change the way many others function [5]. According to Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, "AI is going to eliminate a lot of current jobs, and this is going to change the way that a lot of current jobs function" [5].

The development and deployment of AI technology are being driven by significant investments from big tech companies, with Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon being among the leaders in this space [4]. These companies are investing heavily in AI research and development, as well as expanding their data centers to support the growing demand for AI-powered services [4

Artificial Intelligence has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly with the introduction of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, which can conduct conversations, write computer code, compose music, and craft essays [3]. This has raised concerns about the potential impact of AI on jobs, with some experts predicting that it could eliminate a significant number of current jobs and change the way many others function [5]. According to Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, "AI is going to eliminate a lot of current jobs, and this is going to change the way that a lot of current jobs function" [5].

The development and deployment of AI technology are being driven by significant investments from big tech companies, with Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon being among the leaders in this space [4].

2024-11-08 11:46:27,621: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What does \"AI\" stand for in the context of technology?

2024-11-08 11:46:27,621: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: In the context of technology, "AI" stands for Artificial Intelligence [5]. This refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making [5]. The term has been around for decades, with early versions of AI emerging in the 1950s, such as the Logic Theorist, a problem-solving computer program developed at what is now Carnegie Mellon University [5].

Artificial Intelligence has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly with the introduction of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, which can conduct conversations, write computer code, compose music, and craft essays [3]. This has raised concerns about the potential impact of AI on jobs, with some experts predicting that it could eliminate a significant number of current jobs and change the way many others function [5]. According to Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, "AI is going to eliminate a lot of current jobs, and this is going to change the way that a lot of current jobs function" [5].

The development and deployment of AI technology are being driven by significant investments from big tech companies, with Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon being among the leaders in this space [4]. These companies are investing heavily in AI research and development, as well as expanding their data centers to support the growing demand for AI-powered services [4]. As AI continues to evolve and improve, it is likely to have a profound impact on a wide range of industries and aspects of our lives [12].
