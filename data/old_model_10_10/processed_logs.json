                "text": "Two nights before Prime Minister Rishi Sunak surprised the UK by calling a snap election, crypto executives were sipping wine and eating canapes on a House of Commons terrace, part of a months-long bid to build stronger links with British lawmakers and power brokers. \\n\\nThe event was organized by US-based crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc. and its adviser, former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne. But while senior members of both of Britain\u2019s two dominant political parties were there, the influence campaign had increasingly targeted Labour, given its large and consistent lead in polls. \\n\\nSunak\u2019s decision to call a July 4 election validated that approach, but it also underscored the sense of uncertainty hanging over crypto in the UK. Labour hasn\u2019t been in power since 2010, when Bitcoin was worth less than a dollar. And its leader, Keir Starmer, has been mostly silent on cryptocurrencies. \\n\\n\u201cEveryone is trying to guess,\u201d what Starmer intends to do in crypto regulation should Labour win, said Laura Navaratnam, UK policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation. \u201cPart of the answer here is quite possibly that Labour don\u2019t know what they think yet.\u201d",

According to Ray Kurzweil, an American inventor and futurist, mind-reading technology could potentially \"radically lengthen\" our lifespan by allowing us to backup and restore our minds [2]. However, this raises important philosophical questions about the nature of identity and self. If we could restore our mind file after biological death, would we really be restoring ourselves?

The cloud already has many backups of all of the information it contains, a feature that will be greatly enhanced by the 2040s. Destroying all copies of oneself may be close to impossible. If we design mind-backup systems in such a way that a person can easily choose to delete their files (hoping to maximize personal autonomy), this inherently creates security risks where a person could be tricked or coerced into making such a choice and could increase vulnerability to cyberattacks. \\n\\nOn the other hand, limiting people\u2019s ability to control this most intimate of their data impinges on an important freedom.

Consider, for instance, his beef with America\\'s trade representatives: It\\'s that they have low name recognition. \"Who are these people?\" Trump sputtered at one point. \"Nobody\\'s ever heard of them!\" As for candidates who had made less money than he: \"They\\'re losers.

But before examining that question, let us first pose another: Why all the current fascination with Donald Trump?\\nHe is only the 27th-largest developer in the U.S., according to Building Design and Construction magazine, and is not even the biggest in New York. He has built only three buildings in Manhattan; dozens of other developers have exerted more influence on Gotham\\'s skyline. As a corporate shark, the Great White Yuppie draws yawns on Wall Street. A takeover lawyer told Fortune (September 28): \"I haven\\'t the slightest idea what he\\'s doing. He\\'s in and out, in and out.

In Trump\\'s reality show, The Apprentice, he and two lieutenants monitor contestants as they backstab their way to a $250,000-a-year job as president of one of his companies. In Trump\\'s real life he has managed--by force of personality, insane attention to certain details, charisma, bluntness, self-promotion, and connections--to build an empire of steel, marble, beauty pageants, casinos, and some of the most incredible moldings you\\'ll ever see. The total value? If you believe Trump, $6 billion. But few people actually believe him. And there\\'s good reason. Trump is the Reality Tycoon. He lives his life straight out of the Survivor handbook: Start with the truth, then add enough drama, celebrity, sex, and what might very charitably be called creative editing to make something entirely outlandish. What The Bachelor is to dating and American Idol is to singing in the shower, Trump is to business. He dabbles in the world of management and money as we know it: working through deals, meeting",

The cloud already has many backups of all of the information it contains, a feature that will be greatly enhanced by the 2040s. Destroying all copies of oneself may be close to impossible. If we design mind-backup systems in such a way that a person can easily choose to delete their files (hoping to maximize personal autonomy), this inherently creates security risks where a person could be tricked or coerced into making such a choice and could increase vulnerability to cyberattacks. \\n\\nOn the other hand, limiting people\u2019s ability to control this most intimate of their data impinges on an important freedom.

Hassabis is the CEO of Google\u2019s DeepMind <https://fortune.com/company/deepmind/> AI unit, while Jumper is a director there.\\n\\nThe pair received the award for their work on the AlphaFold 2 AI model, which in 2020 stunned the scientific world <https://fortune.com/2020/11/30/deepmind-solved-protein-folding-alphafold/> with its ability to correctly predict the structure of almost all known proteins from their DNA sequences. Previously, computer software was much less accurate at predicting protein structures, while imaging methods to discover the shape of proteins were time-consuming and costly.\\n\\nThis breakthrough was hugely impactful since proteins are the engines behind most biological processes, with their shape determining their function. Among other things, being able to predict the shape of a protein unlocks better understanding of disease and could enable researchers to more quickly develop new drugs.",

More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit. In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning. The sensing devices in Midas will presumably be infrared, or heat, detectors. Half a dozen or so polar-orbit satellites, spaced one behind the other, could maintain a constant patrol over",

The Space Age will test the ability of two very different societies to mobilize their industrial skills, to draw up long-range plans, to make complex decisions, to educate for the tremendous scientific challenges ahead, and to create congenial environments for some of their most creative minds. Premier Khrushchev once proposed that the U.S. and Russia compete in a friendly \"shooting match\" to test the accuracy of the ICBM\\'s of the two nations. The space contest actually in progress is more pervasive and far more fateful for world history than the match Khrushchev proposed. And, on the record to date, Russia is ahead.

On the other hand, Russia may decide to try for an immediate military-political payoff by putting a communication satellite into a twenty-four-hour orbit, 22,000 miles above the equator. At this altitude a satellite will revolve once around the earth in exactly twenty-four hours and thus, if rotating eastward,",

In the twenty-one months of the new age, the White House, Congress, and the U.S. public have had quite an education. When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled \"Introduction to Outer Space,\" prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, \"This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists.\" This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact. Since the testimony, running to more than 600 pages, is the most complete account yet given of NASA\\'s program, some of its highlights are worth recording here.

From nose cones to satellites To keep the IRBM and ICBM program on its incredibly tight schedule, a high-level government decision was made in 1955 not to allot any of the military missiles to the I.G.Y. program for space exploration. Instead, the nonmilitary Martin Vanguard, based on the Viking--a high-altitude or \"sounding\" rocket--was designated to loft the nation\\'s first satellite. The Naval Research Laboratory was given a parsimonious $20 million for the project, which has now absorbed over $120 million. Chafing under this decision, Major General John B. Medaris, then commander of ABMA, encouraged von Braun to get on with a modification of Redstone called Jupiter-C, which carried enlarged fuel tanks and three upper stages of solid-fuel rockets provided by J.P.L.

As it can be difficult to find time to read longer novels, I have also enjoyed reading short stories, like: \u201cMaster and Man\u201d by Leo Tolstoy; \u201cGooseberries\u201d by Anton Chekhov. Lately, I have been exploring books on soil health and regenerative agriculture; one of the first being \u201cDirt to Soil\u201d by Gabe Brown.\\nNorman Borlaug , 1970 Nobel Peace Prize.

Martin Balsam\\'s question, originally applied to Holly Golightly, is just as central here. It is also appropriate: Trump, after all, is the man who purchased Tiffany\\'s air rights to clear the way for a monument to himself, Trump Tower, and thereupon replaced Holly as the most famous social climber ever to hang out at 57th and Fifth. But before examining that question, let us first pose another: Why all the current fascination with Donald Trump?\\nHe is only the 27th-largest developer in the U.S., according to Building Design and Construction magazine, and is not even the biggest in New York. He has built only three buildings in Manhattan; dozens of other developers have exerted more influence on Gotham\\'s skyline. As a corporate shark, the Great White Yuppie draws yawns on Wall Street. A takeover lawyer told Fortune (September 28): \"I haven\\'t the slightest idea what he\\'s doing. He\\'s in and out, in and out. It\\'s hard to separate the man from the publicity.\" He is certainly not the billionaire he claims he is, not by Fortune\u2019s reckoning (or Forbes\u2019s).",

Sure, Samantha may have [SPOILER ALERT] abandoned the film\u2019s lovelorn protagonist at the end of that story, but who cares? This is about the technical achievement, right?\\n\\nOnly it isn\u2019t. We have now crossed into the territory of potential seduction, and I don\u2019t mean that in a romantic sense. A realistic text conversation with an AI is impressive and in some cases useful, but a realistic voice, paired with the ability to perceive the user\u2019s appearance and environment, is something else. This is technology that will be able to convincingly influence and cajole the user, and its arrival means we will have to pay very close attention to the compulsions of the entity behind the voice.",

                "text": "the makeup of Donald Trump: the pomposity, the shallowness, and above all, the need for more money, more toys, and more attention. Is he a real phony or just a regular phony? Martin Balsam\\'s question, originally applied to Holly Golightly, is just as central here. It is also appropriate: Trump, after all, is the man who purchased Tiffany\\'s air rights to clear the way for a monument to himself, Trump Tower, and thereupon replaced Holly as the most famous social climber ever to hang out at 57th and Fifth. But before examining that question, let us first pose another: Why all the current fascination with Donald Trump?\\nHe is only the 27th-largest developer in the U.S., according to Building Design and Construction magazine, and is not even the biggest in New York. He has built only three buildings in Manhattan; dozens of other developers have exerted more influence on Gotham\\'s skyline. As a corporate shark, the Great White Yuppie draws yawns on Wall Street. A takeover lawyer told Fortune (September 28): \"I haven\\'t the slightest idea what he\\'s doing. He\\'s in and out, in and out. It\\'s hard to separate the man from the publicity.\" He is certainly not the billionaire he claims he is, not by Fortune\u2019s reckoning (or Forbes\u2019s).",

Each role is critical, and bees are promoted through these positions as they age. The lesson? Managers should consider these changing strengths when assigning roles and seek out when employees are ready for a progression.\\n* Focus on creating lasting value: Much like focusing on the honey can distract you from thinking long-term about the hive, an overemphasis on current products may hinder disruptive innovations. For instance, solving internet load issues in 1994 led to high-speed internet and the smartphone revolution. Similarly, if we were too focused on the benefits of Wi-Fi alone (the current honey), we would have missed the need for seamless connectivity across Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellite networks. This convergence led to the development of fiber-optic technology, which is now the backbone of high-capacity communication networks. An enterprise mindset is crucial here.

Bees are adept at learning and can have multiple jobs in their lifetime, ranging from nurse bees and guard bees to foragers. Each role is critical, and bees are promoted through these positions as they age. The lesson? Managers should consider these changing strengths when assigning roles and seek out when employees are ready for a progression.\\n* Focus on creating lasting value: Much like focusing on the honey can distract you from thinking long-term about the hive, an overemphasis on current products may hinder disruptive innovations. For instance, solving internet load issues in 1994 led to high-speed internet and the smartphone revolution. Similarly, if we were too focused on the benefits of Wi-Fi alone (the current honey), we would have missed the need for seamless connectivity across Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellite networks. This convergence led to the development of fiber-optic technology, which is now the backbone of high-capacity communication networks. An enterprise mindset is crucial here. We invent the future when we push the boundaries of the present and challenge the status quo. Each individual\u2019s efforts should align with the broader goals of the organization and focus on creating lasting value.",

However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried.",

This refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making [5]. The term has been around for decades, with early versions of AI emerging in the 1950s, such as the Logic Theorist, a problem-solving computer program built at what is now Carnegie Mellon University [5].",

First, they test your idea, evaluating its potential, economics, supply chain support, infrastructure needs, timing, operational impact, and its ability to change lives. Once the idea passes this evaluation, these leaders are essential in rallying the team and driving the execution of the innovation.",

Bees are adept at learning and can have multiple jobs in their lifetime, ranging from nurse bees and guard bees to foragers. Each role is critical, and bees are promoted through these positions as they age. The lesson? Managers should consider these changing strengths when assigning roles and seek out when employees are ready for a progression.\\n* Focus on creating lasting value: Much like focusing on the honey can distract you from thinking long-term about the hive, an overemphasis on current products may hinder disruptive innovations. For instance, solving internet load issues in 1994 led to high-speed internet and the smartphone revolution. Similarly, if we were too focused on the benefits of Wi-Fi alone (the current honey), we would have missed the need for seamless connectivity across Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellite networks. This convergence led to the development of fiber-optic technology, which is now the backbone of high-capacity communication networks. An enterprise mindset is crucial here. We invent the future when we push the boundaries of the present and challenge the status quo.

As it can be difficult to find time to read longer novels, I have also enjoyed reading short stories, like: \u201cMaster and Man\u201d by Leo Tolstoy; \u201cGooseberries\u201d by Anton Chekhov. Lately, I have been exploring books on soil health and regenerative agriculture; one of the first being \u201cDirt to Soil\u201d by Gabe Brown.\\nNorman Borlaug , 1970 Nobel Peace Prize.

Obviously, the U.S. is energetically rushing satellites for the same sorts of missions. These efforts are not seriously handicapped by the official U.S. position, expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, \"that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.\" Important military uses of space were visualized by a few scientists at the close of World War II. More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit. In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning. The sensing devices in Midas will presumably be infrared, or heat, detectors. Half a dozen or so polar-orbit satellites, spaced one behind the other, could maintain a constant patrol over",

Premier Khrushchev once proposed that the U.S. and Russia compete in a friendly \"shooting match\" to test the accuracy of the ICBM\\'s of the two nations. The space contest actually in progress is more pervasive and far more fateful for world history than the match Khrushchev proposed. And, on the record to date, Russia is ahead.

It may be placing a man in orbit, or landing an instrument package on the moon.

This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists.\" This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact.

From nose cones to satellites To keep the IRBM and ICBM program on its incredibly tight schedule, a high-level government decision was made in 1955 not to allot any of the military missiles to the I.G.Y. program for space exploration. Instead, the nonmilitary Martin Vanguard, based on the Viking--a high-altitude or \"sounding\" rocket--was designated to loft the nation\\'s first satellite. The Naval Research Laboratory was given a parsimonious $20 million for the project, which has now absorbed over $120 million. Chafing under this decision, Major General John B.

The entire program is under the technical direction of Space Technology Laboratories, a subsidiary of Thompson Ramo Wooldridge. Last December, AFBMD orbited the entire empty shell of an Atlas-the \"talking\" Atlas that broadcast a Christmas message from President Eisenhower. Thors have boosted the heaviest U.S. payloads to date, and Thors and Atlases--and probably Titans--will have growing roles in the space program. There has been intense and understandable rivalry among the three groups, but in countless formal and informal ways the experience and knowledge gained by one have generally been passed on to the others. How this transfer and diffusion of information takes place is one of the marvels of the American industrial system. Space operations require the creation of larger industrial complexes than ever before worked together in peacetime. The outstanding example of this is the great group of companies brought together by the AFBMD to create Thor, Atlas, and Titan. This",

Onboard were a handful of journalists, Trump\\'s son Donny Jr., and his political adviser, Roger Stone, a former Nixon and Reagan handler who favors three-piece pinstriped suits and a pocket watch. Also onboard were some gold-plated sinks, a double bed, and gilt-framed works of art with signatures like \"Renoir.\" Nobody I asked seemed to know if they were real, or to care. \"We\\'ve done internal polls that have been amazing,\" Trump was saying, ensconced in a red-velvet seat while Stone sat nearby in his Jay Gatsby getup. \"If I feel",

In Trump\\'s real life he has managed--by force of personality, insane attention to certain details, charisma, bluntness, self-promotion, and connections--to build an empire of steel, marble, beauty pageants, casinos, and some of the most incredible moldings you\\'ll ever see. The total value? If you believe Trump, $6 billion. But few people actually believe him. And there\\'s good reason. Trump is the Reality Tycoon. He lives his life straight out of the Survivor handbook: Start with the truth, then add enough drama, celebrity, sex, and what might very charitably be called creative editing to make something entirely outlandish.

We\u2019ve already seen what our current tools have done to our abilities to remember phone numbers or navigate city streets, never mind its impact on public trust and mental health.\\n\\nWill AI enhance our expertise or ultimately diminish it?\\n\\nTake, for example, the fact that ChatGPT can take our ideas and mold them into an argument. \u201cWriting and thinking are not separable activities,\u201d Jeremy argued. \u201cI think when you lose your writing ability, you actually lose your thinking ability to some extent.\u201d And if we outsource judgement, he added, \u201cwe will lose the ability to think critically.\u201d",

But while senior members of both of Britain\u2019s two dominant political parties were there, the influence campaign had increasingly targeted Labour, given its large and consistent lead in polls. \\n\\nSunak\u2019s decision to call a July 4 election validated that approach, but it also underscored the sense of uncertainty hanging over crypto in the UK.

More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit.

As it can be difficult to find time to read longer novels, I have also enjoyed reading short stories, like: \u201cMaster and Man\u201d by Leo Tolstoy; \u201cGooseberries\u201d by Anton Chekhov. Lately, I have been exploring books on soil health and regenerative agriculture; one of the first being \u201cDirt to Soil\u201d by Gabe Brown.\\nNorman Borlaug , 1970 Nobel Peace Prize.

Obviously, the U.S. is energetically rushing satellites for the same sorts of missions. These efforts are not seriously handicapped by the official U.S. position, expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, \"that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.\" Important military uses of space were visualized by a few scientists at the close of World War II. More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit. In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning. The sensing devices in Midas will presumably be infrared, or heat, detectors. Half a dozen or so polar-orbit satellites, spaced one behind the other, could maintain a constant patrol over",

This year NASA plans to put up a \"passive\" communication satellite, consisting of a sphere of Mylar plastic film. 100 feet in diameter, which will be inflated after going into orbit at an altitude of 1,000 miles.

For instance, solving internet load issues in 1994 led to high-speed internet and the smartphone revolution. Similarly, if we were too focused on the benefits of Wi-Fi alone (the current honey), we would have missed the need for seamless connectivity across Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellite networks. This convergence led to the development of fiber-optic technology, which is now the backbone of high-capacity communication networks. An enterprise mindset is crucial here.

This refers to a broad field of computer science that focuses on creating machines or software that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making [5]. Artificial intelligence technology has been around for decades, with early versions emerging in the 1950s, such as the Logic Theorist, a problem-solving computer program built at what is now Carnegie Mellon University [5].",

For instance, solving internet load issues in 1994 led to high-speed internet and the smartphone revolution. Similarly, if we were too focused on the benefits of Wi-Fi alone (the current honey), we would have missed the need for seamless connectivity across Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellite networks. This convergence led to the development of fiber-optic technology, which is now the backbone of high-capacity communication networks. An enterprise mindset is crucial here.

Obviously, the U.S. is energetically rushing satellites for the same sorts of missions. These efforts are not seriously handicapped by the official U.S. position, expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, \"that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.\" Important military uses of space were visualized by a few scientists at the close of World War II. More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit. In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning. The sensing devices in Midas will presumably be infrared, or heat, detectors. Half a dozen or so polar-orbit satellites, spaced one behind the other, could maintain a constant patrol over",

The space contest actually in progress is more pervasive and far more fateful for world history than the match Khrushchev proposed. And, on the record to date, Russia is ahead.

To provide better global communications NASA is working with the ARPA, and will undertake a number of experiments of its own. This year NASA plans to put up a \"passive\" communication satellite, consisting of a sphere of Mylar plastic film. 100 feet in diameter, which will be inflated after going into orbit at an altitude of 1,000 miles. The aluminized surface of the sphere will reflect high-power radio signals beamed upward from the ground. Messages bounced off the sphere will travel between J.P.L.\\'s big tracking antenna at Goldstone, California, and similar antennas operated on the east coast by Bell Telephone Laboratories and others. The back of the moon Toward the end of the year NASA will try to put a small instrument package, lofted by an Atlas-Able (smaller than Atlas-Vega), into orbit around the moon.

For all its opportunities, AI presents grave dangers too. In Mastering AI, I detail many of these risks, some of which have not received the attention they deserve. Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don\u2019t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse. It will boost fraud, cybercrime, and misinformation. It will erode societal trust and hurt democracy. AI could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. All of these risks are present with AI technology that exists today. There is also a remote\u2014but not completely nonexistent\u2014chance that a superintelligent AI system could pose an existential risk to humanity. It would be wise to devote some effort to taking this last risk off the table, but we should not let these efforts distract or crowd out work we need to do to solve AI\u2019s more immediate",

(He suggested an overmastering need to escape the shadow of his father, Fred, a successful outer-borough developer who died last year and whom Trump rarely mentions.) But the real puzzler is what, exactly, Donald Trump wants. As we walked through the half-gutted lobby of the General Motors <https://fortune.com/company/general-motors/> Building, Trump insisted he most wanted to be respected as a builder. \"The thing I do best is I build,\" he said. \"Everyone says, \\'Oh, Trump is a great promoter.\\' I don\\'t think I\\'m even a good promoter. You build a great product, it becomes successful.\" He paused to touch some tiny bronze fixtures. \"See, these were all corroded\u2014they looked disgusting,\" he said. \"Now it\\'s great, right?\" But even while Trump complains he\\'d like to be covered \"more in business and less in social,\" he can\\'t seem to help himself.

Martin Balsam\\'s question, originally applied to Holly Golightly, is just as central here. It is also appropriate: Trump, after all, is the man who purchased Tiffany\\'s air rights to clear the way for a monument to himself, Trump Tower, and thereupon replaced Holly as the most famous social climber ever to hang out at 57th and Fifth. But before examining that question, let us first pose another: Why all the current fascination with Donald Trump?\\nHe is only the 27th-largest developer in the U.S., according to Building Design and Construction magazine, and is not even the biggest in New York. He has built only three buildings in Manhattan; dozens of other developers have exerted more influence on Gotham\\'s skyline. As a corporate shark, the Great White Yuppie draws yawns on Wall Street. A takeover lawyer told Fortune (September 28): \"I haven\\'t the slightest idea what he\\'s doing. He\\'s in and out, in and out. It\\'s hard to separate the man from the publicity.\" He is certainly not the billionaire he claims he is, not by Fortune\u2019s reckoning (or Forbes\u2019s).",

Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don\u2019t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse. It will boost fraud, cybercrime, and misinformation. It will erode societal trust and hurt democracy. AI could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China.

U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, over one-quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers. Boeing produced around 40% of the 29,000 commercial aircraft filling the skies worldwide. This is the company that launched the jet age; created the world\u2019s first wide-body in its fabled 747; ranks as America\u2019s third biggest defense contractor behind Lockheed Martin <https://fortune.com/company/lockheed-martin/> and RTX <https://fortune.com/company/raytheon-technologies/>, and has long reigned as America\u2019s largest exporter. But Boeing is stumbling just when it should be capitalizing on the boom.\\nPORTLAND, OREGON - JANUARY 7: In this National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) handout, an opening is seen in the fuselage of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 Boeing 737-9 MAX on January 7, 2024 in Portland, Oregon. A door-sized section near the rear of the Boeing 737-9 MAX plane blew off 10 minutes after Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 took off from Portland, Oregon on January 5 on its way to Ontario, California.

I have also enjoyed several books on artificial intelligence and quantum computing, including \u201cQuantum Supremacy\u201d by Michio Kaku.

As it can be difficult to find time to read longer novels, I have also enjoyed reading short stories, like: \u201cMaster and Man\u201d by Leo Tolstoy; \u201cGooseberries\u201d by Anton Chekhov. Lately, I have been exploring books on soil health and regenerative agriculture; one of the first being \u201cDirt to Soil\u201d by Gabe Brown.\\nNorman Borlaug , 1970 Nobel Peace Prize.

        "LLM_answer": "Unfortunately, I don't have information on the largest airline by fleet size. However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried.",

Always have a backup beekeeper (or department head) to ensure steady management, as innovation requires a continuous and steady hand. While the queen leads, the department heads, akin to senior worker bees, are crucial for guidance. When launching a new innovation, these senior workers play pivotal roles in two stages. First, they test your idea, evaluating its potential, economics, supply chain support, infrastructure needs, timing, operational impact, and its ability to change lives. Once the idea passes this evaluation, these leaders are essential in rallying the team and driving the execution of the innovation.",

Bees are adept at learning and can have multiple jobs in their lifetime, ranging from nurse bees and guard bees to foragers. Each role is critical, and bees are promoted through these positions as they age. The lesson? Managers should consider these changing strengths when assigning roles and seek out when employees are ready for a progression.\\n* Focus on creating lasting value: Much like focusing on the honey can distract you from thinking long-term about the hive, an overemphasis on current products may hinder disruptive innovations. For instance, solving internet load issues in 1994 led to high-speed internet and the smartphone revolution. Similarly, if we were too focused on the benefits of Wi-Fi alone (the current honey), we would have missed the need for seamless connectivity across Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellite networks. This convergence led to the development of fiber-optic technology, which is now the backbone of high-capacity communication networks. An enterprise mindset is crucial here. We invent the future when we push the boundaries of the present and challenge the status quo.

Obviously, the U.S. is energetically rushing satellites for the same sorts of missions. These efforts are not seriously handicapped by the official U.S. position, expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, \"that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.\" Important military uses of space were visualized by a few scientists at the close of World War II. More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit. In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning. The sensing devices in Midas will presumably be infrared, or heat, detectors. Half a dozen or so polar-orbit satellites, spaced one behind the other, could maintain a constant patrol over",

The space contest actually in progress is more pervasive and far more fateful for world history than the match Khrushchev proposed. And, on the record to date, Russia is ahead.

Vanguard I may still be aloft in 2959 A.D. \u2022 The Thor-Atlas-Titan program of the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, with Douglas, Convair, and Martin as principal airframe contractors. The entire program is under the technical direction of Space Technology Laboratories, a subsidiary of Thompson Ramo Wooldridge. Last December, AFBMD orbited the entire empty shell of an Atlas-the \"talking\" Atlas that broadcast a Christmas message from President Eisenhower. Thors have boosted the heaviest U.S. payloads to date, and Thors and Atlases--and probably Titans--will have growing roles in the space program. There has been intense and understandable rivalry among the three groups, but in countless formal and informal ways the experience and knowledge gained by one have generally been passed on to the others. How this transfer and diffusion of information takes place is one of the marvels of the American industrial system. Space operations require the creation of larger industrial complexes than ever before worked together in peacetime. The outstanding example of this is the great group of companies brought together by the AFBMD to create Thor, Atlas, and Titan. This",

You build a great product, it becomes successful.\" He paused to touch some tiny bronze fixtures. \"See, these were all corroded\u2014they looked disgusting,\" he said. \"Now it\\'s great, right?\" But even while Trump complains he\\'d like to be covered \"more in business and less in social,\" he can\\'t seem to help himself. In the end, one is simply humbled before the awesome insularity of his logic. \"I own a lot of things that I don\\'t have my name on,\" he explained at one",

Martin Balsam\\'s question, originally applied to Holly Golightly, is just as central here. It is also appropriate: Trump, after all, is the man who purchased Tiffany\\'s air rights to clear the way for a monument to himself, Trump Tower, and thereupon replaced Holly as the most famous social climber ever to hang out at 57th and Fifth. But before examining that question, let us first pose another: Why all the current fascination with Donald Trump?\\nHe is only the 27th-largest developer in the U.S., according to Building Design and Construction magazine, and is not even the biggest in New York. He has built only three buildings in Manhattan; dozens of other developers have exerted more influence on Gotham\\'s skyline. As a corporate shark, the Great White Yuppie draws yawns on Wall Street. A takeover lawyer told Fortune (September 28): \"I haven\\'t the slightest idea what he\\'s doing. He\\'s in and out, in and out. It\\'s hard to separate the man from the publicity.\" He is certainly not the billionaire he claims he is, not by Fortune\u2019s reckoning (or Forbes\u2019s).",

Obviously, the U.S. is energetically rushing satellites for the same sorts of missions. These efforts are not seriously handicapped by the official U.S. position, expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, \"that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.\" Important military uses of space were visualized by a few scientists at the close of World War II. More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit. In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning. The sensing devices in Midas will presumably be infrared, or heat, detectors. Half a dozen or so polar-orbit satellites, spaced one behind the other, could maintain a constant patrol over",

The aluminized surface of the sphere will reflect high-power radio signals beamed upward from the ground. Messages bounced off the sphere will travel between J.P.L.\\'s big tracking antenna at Goldstone, California, and similar antennas operated on the east coast by Bell Telephone Laboratories and others. The back of the moon Toward the end of the year NASA will try to put a small instrument package, lofted by an Atlas-Able (smaller than Atlas-Vega), into orbit around the moon. A photoelectric scanner aboard may give us the first crude glimpse of the back of the moon before the year is out. A somewhat more difficult",

But after spending time with Trump over several weeks, I became convinced otherwise. The man seriously wanted to seek the American presidency\u2014to win, as he put it, \"the whole megillah.\" If that sounds far-fetched, it may be because you haven\\'t yet grasped the governing principles of the Trumpian universe. Consider, for instance, his beef with America\\'s trade representatives: It\\'s that they have low name recognition. \"Who are these people?\" Trump sputtered at one point. \"Nobody\\'s ever heard of them!\" As for candidates who had made less money than he: \"They\\'re losers. Who the hell wants to have a person like this for President?\" More famous, more money: To those who objected that he had no obvious qualifications for politics other than a Bob Dole-like tendency",

As we walked through the half-gutted lobby of the General Motors <https://fortune.com/company/general-motors/> Building, Trump insisted he most wanted to be respected as a builder. \"The thing I do best is I build,\" he said. \"Everyone says, \\'Oh, Trump is a great promoter.\\' I don\\'t think I\\'m even a good promoter.

It is also appropriate: Trump, after all, is the man who purchased Tiffany\\'s air rights to clear the way for a monument to himself, Trump Tower, and thereupon replaced Holly as the most famous social climber ever to hang out at 57th and Fifth. But before examining that question, let us first pose another: Why all the current fascination with Donald Trump?\\nHe is only the 27th-largest developer in the U.S., according to Building Design and Construction magazine, and is not even the biggest in New York. He has built only three buildings in Manhattan; dozens of other developers have exerted more influence on Gotham\\'s skyline. As a corporate shark, the Great White Yuppie draws yawns on Wall Street. A takeover lawyer told Fortune (September 28): \"I haven\\'t the slightest idea what he\\'s doing. He\\'s in and out, in and out. It\\'s hard to separate the man from the publicity.\" He is certainly not the billionaire he claims he is, not by Fortune\u2019s reckoning (or Forbes\u2019s).",

In Trump\\'s reality show, The Apprentice, he and two lieutenants monitor contestants as they backstab their way to a $250,000-a-year job as president of one of his companies. In Trump\\'s real life he has managed--by force of personality, insane attention to certain details, charisma, bluntness, self-promotion, and connections--to build an empire of steel, marble, beauty pageants, casinos, and some of the most incredible moldings you\\'ll ever see. The total value? If you believe Trump, $6 billion. But few people actually believe him. And there\\'s good reason. Trump is the Reality Tycoon. He lives his life straight out of the Survivor handbook: Start with the truth, then add enough drama, celebrity, sex, and what might very charitably be called creative editing to make something entirely outlandish. What The Bachelor is to dating and American Idol is to singing in the shower, Trump is to business. He dabbles in the world of management and money as we know it: working through deals, meeting",

Honeybees achieve this through a distinct governance structure in which the queen sets the tone for the characteristics and culture of her hive, but she wisely leans on counsel from an older generation of worker bees\u2014acting as the board of directors that guide the rank and file of the colony.\\n\\nBeekeeping distills the key tools you need for managing innovation cycles: how to support growth into new levels of scale; shepherding the team\u2019s strengths and development; and the importance of establishing a culture of enthusiasm. But perhaps more unexpected than anything else, you learn not to overly focus on the honey, and instead to keep your primary focus on building the best box for the bees.\\n\\nThe box is your organization",

Hassabis is the CEO of Google\u2019s DeepMind <https://fortune.com/company/deepmind/> AI unit, while Jumper is a director there.\\n\\nThe pair received the award for their work on the AlphaFold 2 AI model, which in 2020 stunned the scientific world <https://fortune.com/2020/11/30/deepmind-solved-protein-folding-alphafold/> with its ability to correctly predict the structure of almost all known proteins from their DNA sequences. Previously, computer software was much less accurate at predicting protein structures, while imaging methods to discover the shape of proteins were time-consuming and costly.\\n\\nThis breakthrough was hugely impactful since proteins are the engines behind most biological processes, with their shape determining their function. Among other things, being able to predict the shape of a protein unlocks better understanding of disease and could enable researchers to more quickly develop new drugs.",

Obviously, the U.S. is energetically rushing satellites for the same sorts of missions. These efforts are not seriously handicapped by the official U.S. position, expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, \"that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.\" Important military uses of space were visualized by a few scientists at the close of World War II. More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit. In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning. The sensing devices in Midas will presumably be infrared, or heat, detectors. Half a dozen or so polar-orbit satellites, spaced one behind the other, could maintain a constant patrol over",

Messages bounced off the sphere will travel between J.P.L.\\'s big tracking antenna at Goldstone, California, and similar antennas operated on the east coast by Bell Telephone Laboratories and others. The back of the moon Toward the end of the year NASA will try to put a small instrument package, lofted by an Atlas-Able (smaller than Atlas-Vega), into orbit around the moon. A photoelectric scanner aboard may give us the first crude glimpse of the back of the moon before the year is out. A somewhat more difficult",

As we walked through the half-gutted lobby of the General Motors <https://fortune.com/company/general-motors/> Building, Trump insisted he most wanted to be respected as a builder. \"The thing I do best is I build,\" he said. \"Everyone says, \\'Oh, Trump is a great promoter.\\' I don\\'t think I\\'m even a good promoter.

It is also appropriate: Trump, after all, is the man who purchased Tiffany\\'s air rights to clear the way for a monument to himself, Trump Tower, and thereupon replaced Holly as the most famous social climber ever to hang out at 57th and Fifth. But before examining that question, let us first pose another: Why all the current fascination with Donald Trump?\\nHe is only the 27th-largest developer in the U.S., according to Building Design and Construction magazine, and is not even the biggest in New York. He has built only three buildings in Manhattan; dozens of other developers have exerted more influence on Gotham\\'s skyline. As a corporate shark, the Great White Yuppie draws yawns on Wall Street. A takeover lawyer told Fortune (September 28): \"I haven\\'t the slightest idea what he\\'s doing. He\\'s in and out, in and out. It\\'s hard to separate the man from the publicity.\" He is certainly not the billionaire he claims he is, not by Fortune\u2019s reckoning (or Forbes\u2019s).",

Obviously, the U.S. is energetically rushing satellites for the same sorts of missions. These efforts are not seriously handicapped by the official U.S. position, expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, \"that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.\" Important military uses of space were visualized by a few scientists at the close of World War II. More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit. In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning. The sensing devices in Midas will presumably be infrared, or heat, detectors. Half a dozen or so polar-orbit satellites, spaced one behind the other, could maintain a constant patrol over",

Space operations require the creation of larger industrial complexes than ever before worked together in peacetime. The outstanding example of this is the great group of companies brought together by the AFBMD to create Thor, Atlas, and Titan. This",

This year NASA plans to put up a \"passive\" communication satellite, consisting of a sphere of Mylar plastic film. 100 feet in diameter, which will be inflated after going into orbit at an altitude of 1,000 miles.

Also onboard were some gold-plated sinks, a double bed, and gilt-framed works of art with signatures like \"Renoir.\" Nobody I asked seemed to know if they were real, or to care. \"We\\'ve done internal polls that have been amazing,\" Trump was saying, ensconced in a red-velvet seat while Stone sat nearby in his Jay Gatsby getup. \"If I feel",

These efforts are not seriously handicapped by the official U.S. position, expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, \"that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.\" Important military uses of space were visualized by a few scientists at the close of World War II. More than a year before the flight of Sputnik I, Lockheed was awarded the Sentry Project, aimed at building reconnaissance satellites. The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit. In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning. The sensing devices in Midas will presumably be infrared, or heat, detectors. Half a dozen or so polar-orbit satellites, spaced one behind the other, could maintain a constant patrol over",

This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists.\" This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact. Since the testimony, running to more than 600 pages, is the most complete account yet given of NASA\\'s program, some of its highlights are worth recording here. Mapping and cloud hunting During the rest of 1959 and 1960, NASA expects to fire a total of nearly 150 sounding rockets to gather detailed information on the earth\\'s",

Ramo Wooldridge was formed in late 1953 by two brilliant scientist-engineers, Simon Ramo and Dean Wooldridge, who had pulled out of Hughes Aircraft. They had already brought into their new company some of the country\\'s leading rocket and electronics experts when the Air Force picked them for the unprecedented ballistic-missile job. From nose cones to satellites To keep the IRBM and ICBM program on its incredibly tight schedule, a high-level government decision was made in 1955 not to allot any of the military missiles to the I.G.Y. program for space exploration. Instead, the nonmilitary Martin Vanguard, based on the Viking--a high-altitude or \"sounding\" rocket--was designated to loft the nation\\'s first satellite. The Naval Research Laboratory was given a parsimonious $20 million for the project, which has now absorbed over $120 million. Chafing under this decision, Major General John B. Medaris, then commander of ABMA, encouraged von Braun to get on with a modification of Redstone called Jupiter-C, which carried enlarged fuel tanks and three upper stages of solid-fuel rockets provided by J.P.L. The function of Jupiter-C was to hurl experimental nose",

Thors have boosted the heaviest U.S. payloads to date, and Thors and Atlases--and probably Titans--will have growing roles in the space program. There has been intense and understandable rivalry among the three groups, but in countless formal and informal ways the experience and knowledge gained by one have generally been passed on to the others. How this transfer and diffusion of information takes place is one of the marvels of the American industrial system.

Martin Balsam\\'s question, originally applied to Holly Golightly, is just as central here. It is also appropriate: Trump, after all, is the man who purchased Tiffany\\'s air rights to clear the way for a monument to himself, Trump Tower, and thereupon replaced Holly as the most famous social climber ever to hang out at 57th and Fifth. But before examining that question, let us first pose another: Why all the current fascination with Donald Trump?\\nHe is only the 27th-largest developer in the U.S., according to Building Design and Construction magazine, and is not even the biggest in New York. He has built only three buildings in Manhattan; dozens of other developers have exerted more influence on Gotham\\'s skyline. As a corporate shark, the Great White Yuppie draws yawns on Wall Street. A takeover lawyer told Fortune (September 28): \"I haven\\'t the slightest idea what he\\'s doing. He\\'s in and out, in and out. It\\'s hard to separate the man from the publicity.\" He is certainly not the billionaire he claims he is, not by Fortune\u2019s reckoning (or Forbes\u2019s).",

Since then, the European Union (from which the UK voted in 2016 to part ways) has adopted sweeping crypto legislation, and rival financial centers like Hong Kong and Dubai have introduced new regulations. \\n\\nBy contrast, the UK mostly relies on a patchwork of crypto rules mainly enforced by the Financial Conduct Authority.
