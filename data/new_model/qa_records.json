This highlights the significance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological stability and supporting human well-being. [2]\n\nThe importance of biodiversity extends beyond forests to oceans, which provide services that scientists call \"existentially important\". Oceans produce more than half of the oxygen we breathe, serve as the world's largest carbon sink, and absorb 30% of our carbon emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by them. The loss of biodiversity in oceans would have catastrophic consequences for the planet's health. Furthermore, biodiversity is essential for maintaining healthy ecosystems, which in turn support human health. As noted in , the collapse of healthcare systems, widespread food and water shortages, and mass displacement will become our new reality if action is not taken to address the health threats of climate change. [4] [3]\n\nThe preservation of biodiversity is also critical for the economy, as it presents a significant opportunity for investment and growth. According to , Boston Consulting Group estimates that nature is a more than $1.2 trillion opportunity, with the largest investments to be made in sectors including chemicals, power utilities, food and beverage, and healthcare. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize biodiversity conservation to ensure the long-term health of the planet and its inhabitants. [1]"

Furthermore, the extraction and transportation of fossil fuels, like natural gas, can lead to methane leaks, further exacerbating the problem [9].\n\nThe consequences of global warming are far-reaching and devastating,According to scientists, global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and others, into the atmosphere [1]. The burning of fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal is a significant contributor to the increase in greenhouse gases, leading to a rise in global temperatures [1].
