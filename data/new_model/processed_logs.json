In an interview with Fortune magazine in 1993, Mandela discussed his plans for the economy and his vision for the future of South Africa [1]. He emphasized the importance of foreign investment and creating jobs for the people of South Africa, stating that \"any strategy that will achieve that objective, I would support\" [1]. Mandela's leadership marked a significant turning point in South African history, as he worked to rebuild the country and promote reconciliation after the end of apartheid.",

Interview by Marshall Loeb; reporter associate Jane Furth July 12, 1993. A NEW ERA IS DAWNING in relations between the U.S. and South Africa. Full- scale trade and investment will soon resume, as Nelson Mandela calls for an end to all sanctions. Almost certainly, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress will become the first black President of his country after the first truly universal elections are held next spring. On the eve of his visit to the U.S. to receive the Liberty Medal, Mandela was vigorous and erect despite having spent 27 of his 74 years in South African prisons. He talked in Johannesburg with FORTUNE managing editor Marshall Loeb about the future he foresees for South Africa's economy and the important role foreign business will play.

Growth has been less than the growth of the population. Naturally we require foreign investment. I would not restrict it to any particular kind of company. What we are primarily interested in is development that creates opportunities for employment, because 48% of our people are unemployed. And we are therefore very keen for foreign companies to invest in such a way that there will be a creation of jobs for our people, a generation of wealth. All foreign companies that invest would be guaranteed against expropriation and nationalization. They will be able to recover their profits and dividends -- all of them. We are guaranteeing every foreign company that invests in our country. Would it be fair and accurate to have a headline in FORTUNE read: MANDELA WELCOMES FOREIGN INVESTMENT?",

He grew up in Queens, New York, one of two children (he has a younger sister named Enid) of Fredric and Hannah Kurzweil, Viennese Jews who fled the Nazis in 1938. His parents encouraged their son\\'s ambition. \"Ideas were the religion of our household,\" he says. \"They saw science and technology as the way of the future and a way to make money and not struggle the way they did.\" Fredric, a composer and conductor, died of heart disease at 58, an event that would have a lasting impact on his son. Kurzweil discovered computers at age 12, and quickly demonstrated an amazing facility with technology. At 14 he wangled a job as the computer programmer at the research department of Head Start, the federal government\\'s early-childhood-development program. While there he wrote software that was later distributed by IBM <https://fortune.com/company/ibm/> (IBM) with its mainframes. At 17 he won an international science contest by building a computer that analyzed the works of Chopin and Beethoven to compose music; that trick landed him on the TV show",

In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials. The second discovery was that there are extensive irregularities in gravity over the earth, like great shallow hills and bowls. Eight major gravity anomalies have been located, the two greatest being a deep depression or \"bowl\"",

This is about the technical achievement, right?\\n\\nOnly it isn\u2019t. We have now crossed into the territory of potential seduction, and I don\u2019t mean that in a romantic sense. A realistic text conversation with an AI is impressive and in some cases useful, but a realistic voice, paired with the ability to perceive the user\u2019s appearance and environment, is something else. This is technology that will be able to convincingly influence and cajole the user, and its arrival means we will have to pay very close attention to the compulsions of the entity behind the voice.",

Clarke, a renowned science fiction writer, predicted, machines could become the most intelligent inhabitants of the future world, surpassing human intelligence [2].",

The most important is to ensure we don\u2019t allow AI to displace the central role that human decision-making and empathy should play in high-consequence domains, from law enforcement and military affairs to lending and social welfare decisions. Beyond this, we need to encourage the development of AI as a complement to human intelligence and skills, rather than a replacement. This requires us to reframe how we think about AI and how we assess its capabilities. Benchmarking that evaluates how well humans can perform when paired with AI software\u2014as opposed to constantly pitting AI\u2019s abilities against those of people\u2014would be a good place to start.

If they could, the theorem would be disproved. Fortunately they have not had to test every conceivable combination of numbers; it is sufficient to try substituting all prime numbers for n.

Goltermann noted there are two main reasons for this phenomenon. First, because of Japan\u2019s low interest rates, the yen is often used in the so-called \u201ccarry trade.\u201d That\u2019s when investors borrow at a low interest rate to invest in an asset with a higher return. \\n\\nFor example, a fund manager might borrow yen and then invest that money in Indian bonds that offer a higher yield, pocketing the difference. It\u2019s slightly more complex than this in practice, as the fund manager in question would also need to swap rupees for dollars, and hedge his dollar risk, but that\u2019s the general idea. \\n\\nAll of this means that when the interest-rate differentials between Japan and other major developed nations are high, traders will rush in to borrow yen for the carry trade, which weighs on the currency. And Bank of America\u2019s analysts warned in a Friday note that the carry trade \u201cis unlikely to start diminishing meaningfully until the Fed starts cutting rates, which our U.S. economists expect in December.\u201d",

One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, \"Study now, pay later,\" but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry. He contends that a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it. He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where \"the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive.\" Van den Haag would have the colleges lend to, or as he sees it, invest in students after raising capital by selling bonds, or simply endorse students\\' notes and rediscount them.

Brookings reported that forgiving all federal student loans would cost an estimated $1.6 trillion as of February 2021; a blanket one-time $10,000 to borrowers would cost about $373 billion.\\n\\nA transfer of wealth of these magnitudes would have a positive effect on the economy, but the \u201cbang for the buck is quite low\u201d compared with other, more progressive endeavors, says Looney, who\u2019s also a professor of finance at the University of Utah. Because people with student loan debt generally earn more money, they won\u2019t benefit as much from relief as other groups would.\\n\\n\u201cThe economic effects of debt forgiveness are exaggerated,\u201d says Looney, whose study of the issue finds that even $10,000 in debt forgiveness would cost roughly as much as the country has spent on food stamps since 2000.

Should some such plan become popular, it might be self-supporting, though providing little, if any, return on the philanthropically contributed capital.

Were such a plan widely used, employers would undoubtedly come around to aiding employees with repayment commitments.\" Some business judgments In recent years Fortune has referred to the views of other advocates of massive credit for higher education. One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, \"Study now, pay later,\" but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry. He contends that a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it. He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where \"the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive.\" Van den Haag would have the colleges lend to or, as he sees it, invest in students after raising capital by selling",

        "LLM_answer": "Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that lead to a slowdown in economic growth.

When people lose their jobs, they stop spending, and more people lose jobs, creating a vicious cycle [2]. This dynamic can feed on itself, leading to a recession.",

But here\\'s the weird thing about Donald Trump: Try as he might to be a figure of ridiculous fun, lie as he might about things large and small, Trump appears to be an enormously skilled developer. Associates describe an unfailing knack for spotting and ferreting out waste; a memory like a Zip drive; a grasp of byzantine zoning laws so detailed that he routinely requires the city to close loopholes only he had the wherewithal (many would say gall) to exploit. There\\'s Trump walking the construction sites every day, yelling that the concrete is the wrong kind, that the marble isn\\'t flat enough, that the ceiling should be ripped out and redone. \"He can look at a type of window glass and tell you what type it is and its energy-efficiency rating,\" says a former employee.

All his deals are buried in layers of corporate names, partners, and either debt or no debt, depending on whether you\\'re talking to Trump. Not that it matters. The more interesting question is not what he owns but how he gets it. And what the heck is it like to work for a man who never turns off? The simple answer to that last question, says Greg Cuneo, chairman of New York construction heavyweight HRH and a man who got his start thanks to Trump, is this: \"Bizarre. Totally fucking bizarre.\" And he means it glowingly. Donald Trump can seem at times like a caricature of himself, and yet he\\'s strangely appealing. He has a warm side--on the flight he cooed over Knauss\\'s sore throat--and a politician\\'s knack for making it seem as if he\\'s telling you something for the first time he\\'s said many times before.

As emphasized in [2], the Congo Basin forests, for instance, are essential for the global fight against climate change, and their loss would set back efforts by 15 to 20 years.

The two outside directors that we managed to talk to, though, Babbio and Knowling, firmly denied that was so. We did not get calls back from director Richard Hackborn, a strong-minded, retired HP executive who built the printer business. Hackborn played a key role in hiring Fiorina in 1999, and she is thought to need his continued support. Without it, her job might be imperiled.

This term refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making (Source 8). AI systems can analyze data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or recommendations, often with greater speed and accuracy than humans (Source 8).

The resulting upheaval must be what Jean Monnet, prophet of European union, had in mind when he predicted that the Common Market would touch off \"a second industrial revolution.\" Like any revolution, this one has plenty of confusion, uncertainty, and casualties. As patterns of competition change and artificially protected preserves are opened up, weak firms must seek shelter or get trampled upon and strong ones cannot take their strength for granted. Yet everyone seems to be looking forward with gusto to the test. A few businessmen expressed concern about what the Common Market might do to their immediate prospects, but none even hinted that he would like to see the process stopped or reversed. The business community that started out with the best reasons to be frightened now embraces the new adventure with the most enthusiasm. A few years ago France looked like the weak sister of Europe. Its politics were in disorder, its morale depressed by the impasse in Algeria. Moreover, its notoriously inefficient industry, fragmented into old, tariff-protected family firms, seemed",

But the thing we won\u2019t win on in my view is let\u2019s just load something up with saturated fat, just make it taste exactly like it. I know enough about life and I\u2019ve been doing this long enough that when I offer people a side-by-side choice and there\u2019s no benefit to consuming the plant-based version and there\u2019s questions about what it\u2019s made from, you don\u2019t win.\u201d\\n\\nI am a huge fan of Brown and am sympathetic to his viewpoint. However, I think there are some flaws in his logic.",

According to various sources, inflation can be defined as a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time (Source 9). This means that as inflation rises, the purchasing power of money falls, and the same amount of money can buy fewer goods and services than it could previously (Source 10).",

Even with demand for oil sinking as a result of the global slowdown, a major supply disruption in the Middle East--particularly if Saudi Arabian production were to be curtailed--is an economic nightmare scenario. That always has been, of course, but it is especially true today given how weak the major economies already are.

That is not the only scenario out there. Perhaps the best Bush can hope for now is that it turns out bin Laden\\'s organization masterminded and financed the Sept. 11 assault on its own.

In the twenty-one months of the new age, the White House, Congress, and the U.S. public have had quite an education. When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled \"Introduction to Outer Space,\" prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, \"This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists.\" This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact. Since the testimony, running to more than 600 pages, is the most complete account yet given of NASA\\'s program, some of its highlights are worth recording here.

Scientists will, of course, get answers to questions of the sort that they know how to ask: What gases are in the atmospheres of other planets? What elements are in their crusts? Are radioactive elements more or less abundant than on earth, and what will they tell us about the ages of other planets? But beyond all this there will certainly be extraordinary surprises. One Rand Corporation scientist likes to indulge in this fantasy: \"Just to explore chunks of lifeless rock isn\\'t going to mean much to many people,\" he points out, \"but suppose when we get to the moon we find sitting in the middle of a crater a strange little marker bearing a carefully chiseled but totally incomprehensible inscription.

As an engineer and beekeeper, I can attest that bees, being pollinators, help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat [1]. Without bees, many plants would be unable to reproduce, and our food supply would be severely impacted.

Managers should consider these changing strengths when assigning roles and seek out when employees are ready for a progression.\\n* Focus on creating lasting value: Much like focusing on the honey can distract you from thinking long-term about the hive, an overemphasis on current products may hinder disruptive innovations. For instance, solving internet load issues in 1994 led to high-speed internet and the smartphone revolution. Similarly, if we were too focused on the benefits of Wi-Fi alone (the current honey), we would have missed the need for seamless connectivity across Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellite networks. This convergence led to the development of fiber-optic technology, which is now the backbone of high-capacity communication networks. An enterprise mindset is crucial here.

That was a year of triage, of a humbling investment from Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/>, of paring Apple\\'s product line to a bare minimum of four computers. By the following year Steve\\'s regime had kicked into gear. Jobs completed the hiring of a new management team, which included several executives from his previous company, Next. Those top players would form the nucleus of the Jobs brain trust for nearly 10 years. Then came the first Macintosh after Jobs\\' return, the iMac, a breakthrough all-in-one computer and monitor that heralded Apple\\'s return to health. The success of the pricey iMac, coupled with drastic cost cutting, allowed Jobs to build a cash cushion. By repairing Apple\\'s balance sheet, he prepared the company for big investments to come, a shrewd business move if ever there was one. Jobs laid the foundation for Apple\\'s leap from stable to stratospheric when things looked darkest. In 2000, Apple missed its financial targets in a September earnings announcement, sending its stock price plummeting in subsequent months to the equivalent of $7 in today\\'s",

An Apple buyout would have been the deal of the century, but according to people familiar with the talks, Jobs ultimately shut them down. That was actually the second serious proposal to buy Apple. In 1997, Jobs\\' friend Ellison, later an Apple board member, lined up financing to take over the company on the assumption that Jobs would run it. In a recent interview Ellison said Jobs didn\\'t like the idea of being \"second-guessed\" if it looked as if he\\'d returned simply to make money. \"He explained to me that with the moral high ground, he thought he could make decisions more easily and more gracefully,\" says Ellison.",

        "LLM_answer": "If there is a lack of rainfall in California, it can have significant impacts on the state's agriculture, economy, and environment. For instance, farmers of alfalfa and other crops that feed cattle have seen the price of hay plummet amid rising supply, making it more lucrative for them to stop watering their fields and instead receive federal funding per acre-foot of water [1]. This is because the water district is willing to pay farmers to conserve water, which is a better option for them than selling their crops at a low price. Additionally, the strong U.S. dollar has made it difficult for hay exporters to find buyers, leading to a surplus of hay in the state [1].",

This ability to move toward where we want to go--or ought to go--is called \"power,\" which, in all its conjunct and disjunct forms (technological, organizational, communicatory), is increasing everywhere.

These deficits were relatively small, but the prosecution of the War shot expenditures up until they were nearly four times as large as Treasury receipts in 1918 and again nearly four times as large in 1919. The $18,500,000,000 that the Treasury poured out that year makes even the $7,000,000,000 of ordinary and extraordinary expenditures in 1934 seem small by comparison. The strain was terrific, but nobody bothered about it, for the courage and purpose to bear it--\"Give till it hurts\"--was everywhere manifest. Certainly a balanced budget is a pleasant thing. Certainly it is a desirable thing. But there are those who, not without reason, question whether it is an essential thing, except over a long period of time-perhaps ten years, perhaps the duration of the business cycle. Their more conservative brethren answer that this is all very well but that it is impossible to plan intelligently for as long a period as ten years or as indefinite a period as a business cycle.

(It is reported by a sports writer, Frank Graham, that Ruppert once admonished pitcher Waite Hoyt: \"You win all your games by scores of 1 to 0 and 2 to 1. Our other pitchers win their games by 9 and 10 to 1. Why don\\'t you win some of your games like that?\") In 1915 the Yankees finished fifth; in 1916, fourth; 1917, sixth; 1918, fourth. The Colonel was not seen at the games very often. Throughout this period the Yankees were paying top prices to other American League clubs for such players as their rivals were willing to sell, but the New York team never rose above mediocrity.
