In the three quarters since Cook become CEO, Apple has reported $31 billion in profits and shipped 89 million iPhones and 38 million iPads, all exceeding Wall Street’s expectations and continuing, by and large, to delight an adoring customer base. “By any', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.69341886), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='9cacbeef-dfa4-49c3-941e-1c7433a6056a', embedding=None, metadata={'id': 'ee59ca95e6a0b7d9d6633a7380aac047fbf8b7723277d0f56ccd81399d9d9c27-1', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': 'ee59ca95e6a0b7d9d6633a7380aac047fbf8b7723277d0f56ccd81399d9d9c27', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20240607, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-07', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2147869295-e1717776163378.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2024, 'date_month': 6, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/apple-tim-cook-wwdc-ai-siri/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 7, 'title': 'Apple’s WWDC is crucial to the company showing it can still compete in the one area that matters', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/apple-tim-cook-wwdc-ai-siri/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Meanwhile, Apple has been mired in the AI mud <https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/openai-gpt4o-apple-ai-tim-cook-wwdc/>.

That\'s led some analysts and financial advisors to caution that the tech giants could be a bit overvalued, which may affect retail investors who are pouring more and more money into index funds.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/06/27/how-much-a-1000-investment-in-apple-stock-10-years-ago-would-be-worth-today/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/27/how-much-a-1000-investment-in-apple-stock-10-years-ago-would-be-worth-today/\n\nSource 4:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/08/13/apple-stock-price-outlook/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/13/apple-stock-price-outlook/\n\nSource 4:\nFor a few years, though, Apple\'s profits remained stuck in the $50 billion range. Then, in the stay at home pandemic economy, sales of its laptops and other staple gear for remote work exploded. Starting in FY 2022, Apple was booking nearly $100 billion in annual profits, twice the number three years earlier.\n\nThe rub: Apple\'s market cap ramped far faster than even the gigantic swing in earnings. By mid-June of this year, its valuation had swelled to $3.2 trillion, over four times the figure in mid-2017. Put simply, Apple\'s profits doubled and its market cap quadrupled, taking its PE from a modest 16 to towering 32. The former deep value play had morphed into the model of a super-high priced tech racer.\n\nApple stock forecast\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/13/apple-stock-price-outlook/\n\nSource 5:\n“The reason Apple has outperformed for more than a decade isn’t because investors are being foolhardy, but because it is executing on a business strategy that works, its earnings plan is working, and its lock on the consumer is only getting stronger,” said Jonathan Curtis, director of portfolio management for Franklin Equity Group.\n\n“The balance sheet is phenomenal, it pays a dividend it can continue to grow, it has an active repurchasing program, and a consumer staples-esque platform business, all powered by a device people look at four hours a day,” Curtis said. \n\nIn a sign of Wall Street’s ongoing optimism about the stock, Citi on Thursday began coverage <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/apple-has-another-30-upside-citi-says-in-new-buy-rating> of Apple with a buy rating, writing that its ability to continue expanding margins was underappreciated. It sees additional upside of about 30% for the stock, a target that would take Apple close to a $4 trillion valuation.\n\nThe Trillion-Dollar Club\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2023/06/30/apple-history-3-trillion-market-value/\n\nSource 5:\nWhile Apple is not the biggest gainer of the year — Nvidia, Meta Platforms <https://fortune.com/company/facebook/> Inc., and Tesla <https://fortune.com/company/tesla/> Inc. have more than doubled — its size gives it a massive influence over markets, accounting for 7.7% of the weight of the S&P 500 Index.\n\nStill, the milestone doesn’t mean smooth sailing for Apple from here. The stock trades at about 30 times forward earnings, and while this is down from a 2020 peak above 35, it remains well above its 10-year average multiple of 17.9.\nDespite Citi’s new bull call, analysts have been pulling back on the stock amid the year’s rally. Fewer than 70% of the firms tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, the lowest such ratio among the trillion-dollar stocks.
