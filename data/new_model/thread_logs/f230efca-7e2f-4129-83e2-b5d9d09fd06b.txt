He grew up in Queens, New York, one of two children (he has a younger sister named Enid) of Fredric and Hannah Kurzweil, Viennese Jews who fled the Nazis in 1938. His parents encouraged their son\'s ambition. "Ideas were the religion of our household," he says. "They saw science and technology as the way of the future and a way to make money and not struggle the way they did." Fredric, a composer and conductor, died of heart disease at 58, an event that would have a lasting impact on his son. Kurzweil discovered computers at age 12, and quickly demonstrated an amazing facility with technology. At 14 he wangled a job as the computer programmer at the research department of Head Start, the federal government\'s early-childhood-development program. While there he wrote software that was later distributed by IBM <https://fortune.com/company/ibm/> (IBM) with its mainframes.

There\'s a pipe-smoking mannequin with a ribbon that reads "I AM AN INVENTOR" on its chest. In the basement is a supercomputer processing millions of bits of market-related data. Kurzweil is hoping that FatKat will prove to be as spectacular an achievement as his early inventions, only a lot more lucrative.

Hinton’s work was pivotal, but it stood on the shoulders of earlier research. Werbos and Amari’s contributions were critical to the development of neural network techniques that would later power breakthroughs like AlphaGo and OpenAI’s GPT. These technologies didn’t materialize out of thin air—they were the result of decades of incremental progress. Focusing too much on individual figures distorts the reality of technological advancement, which is nearly always a collaborative, multi-layered process.\n\nThis brings us to a fundamental truth about innovation: Being the first to develop an idea isn’t as important as being the one who refines, scales, and executes it effectively. Innovation is not about singular genius—it’s about collective progress. When we only credit the most visible figures, we miss the contributions of those who laid the groundwork for breakthroughs.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Hinton’s Nobel Prize should spark a reevaluation of how we recognize innovation.

The oversight in Hinton’s case reflects a broader misunderstanding of innovation itself. The myth of the lone genius, often epitomized by figures like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, dominates public narratives, leading us to believe that major breakthroughs occur in isolation. In reality, most advances result from cumulative, collaborative efforts. While Hinton’s recognition is deserved, it underscores a common flaw in how credit is distributed: The contributions of early pioneers often fade from view as those who build upon their work take the spotlight.\n\nThis is not a problem unique to AI. The history of technology is full of similar stories. Steve Jobs didn’t invent the iPhone from scratch. The iPhone was the product of incremental innovations in smartphones, just as the Macintosh borrowed heavily from innovations developed at Xerox <https://fortune.com/company/xerox/> PARC.

Werbos and Amari’s contributions were critical to the development of neural network techniques that would later power breakthroughs like AlphaGo and OpenAI’s GPT.

Focusing too much on individual figures distorts the reality of technological advancement, which is nearly always a collaborative, multi-layered process.\n\nThis brings us to a fundamental truth about innovation: Being the first to develop an idea isn’t as important as being the one who refines, scales, and executes it effectively. Innovation is not about singular genius—it’s about collective progress. When we only credit the most visible figures, we miss the contributions of those who laid the groundwork for breakthroughs.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Hinton’s Nobel Prize should spark a reevaluation of how we recognize innovation.

The oversight in Hinton’s case reflects a broader misunderstanding of innovation itself. The myth of the lone genius, often epitomized by figures like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, dominates public narratives, leading us to believe that major breakthroughs occur in isolation. In reality, most advances result from cumulative, collaborative efforts. While Hinton’s recognition is deserved, it underscores a common flaw in how credit is distributed: The contributions of early pioneers often fade from view as those who build upon their work take the spotlight.\n\nThis is not a problem unique to AI. The history of technology is full of similar stories. Steve Jobs didn’t invent the iPhone from scratch.

The oversight in Hinton’s case reflects a broader misunderstanding of innovation itself. The myth of the lone genius, often epitomized by figures like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, dominates public narratives, leading us to believe that major breakthroughs occur in isolation. In reality, most advances result from cumulative, collaborative efforts. While Hinton’s recognition is deserved, it underscores a common flaw in how credit is distributed: The contributions of early pioneers often fade from view as those who build upon their work take the spotlight.\n\nThis is not a problem unique to AI. The history of technology is full of similar stories. Steve Jobs didn’t invent the iPhone from scratch. The iPhone was the product of incremental innovations in smartphones, just as the Macintosh borrowed heavily from innovations developed at Xerox <https://fortune.com/company/xerox/> PARC. Jobs’s brilliance lies in refining these technologies—making them intuitive and accessible to the masses.

Hinton’s work was pivotal, but it stood on the shoulders of earlier research. Werbos and Amari’s contributions were critical to the development of neural network techniques that would later power breakthroughs like AlphaGo and OpenAI’s GPT. These technologies didn’t materialize out of thin air—they were the result of decades of incremental progress. Focusing too much on individual figures distorts the reality of technological advancement, which is nearly always a collaborative, multi-layered process.\n\nThis brings us to a fundamental truth about innovation: Being the first to develop an idea isn’t as important as being the one who refines, scales, and executes it effectively. Innovation is not about singular genius—it’s about collective progress. When we only credit the most visible figures, we miss the contributions of those who laid the groundwork for breakthroughs.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Hinton’s Nobel Prize should spark a reevaluation of how we recognize innovation.

The oversight in Hinton’s case reflects a broader misunderstanding of innovation itself. The myth of the lone genius, often epitomized by figures like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, dominates public narratives, leading us to believe that major breakthroughs occur in isolation. In reality, most advances result from cumulative, collaborative efforts. While Hinton’s recognition is deserved, it underscores a common flaw in how credit is distributed: The contributions of early pioneers often fade from view as those who build upon their work take the spotlight.\n\nThis is not a problem unique to AI. The history of technology is full of similar stories. Steve Jobs didn’t invent the iPhone from scratch. The iPhone was the product of incremental innovations in smartphones, just as the Macintosh borrowed heavily from innovations developed at Xerox <https://fortune.com/company/xerox/> PARC.

When I profiled her for Fortune <https://fortune.com/longform/billionaire-female-founders-sara-blakely-anne-wojcicki-whitney-wolfe-herd-blackstone/> in 2021, those were the terms in which she described herself. The Spanx origin story isn\'t about building a business from scratch, but inventing a product that hadn\'t existed before. (To be clear, other brands have introduced heel-sneaker crossovers in the past <https://www.vogue.com/article/sara-blakely-sneaker-heels-sneex-interview-test-drive>.) Blakely likes solving problems and getting in the weeds; for Spanx that meant writing her patent herself rather than hiring a lawyer. For Sneex, it was trying multiple manufacturers and factories over the course of a decade. She couldn\'t believe that male factory owners in Italy and Spain had never tried on the shoes they make, she said yesterday.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/21/sara-blakely-spanx-founder-launches-sneex/\n\nSource 2:\nKurzweil, 59, declared his career as an inventor at age 5. He grew up in Queens, New York, one of two children (he has a younger sister named Enid) of Fredric and Hannah Kurzweil, Viennese Jews who fled the Nazis in 1938. His parents encouraged their son\'s ambition. "Ideas were the religion of our household," he says. "They saw science and technology as the way of the future and a way to make money and not struggle the way they did." Fredric, a composer and conductor, died of heart disease at 58, an event that would have a lasting impact on his son. Kurzweil discovered computers at age 12, and quickly demonstrated an amazing facility with technology. At 14 he wangled a job as the computer programmer at the research department of Head Start, the federal government\'s early-childhood-development program. While there he wrote software that was later distributed by IBM <https://fortune.com/company/ibm/> (IBM) with its mainframes. At 17 he won an international science contest by building a computer that analyzed the works of Chopin and Beethoven to compose music; that trick landed him on the TV show\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/ray-kurzweil-innovation-artificial-intelligence/\n\nSource 2:\nThese days Kurzweil organizes his business interests—including FatKat and Ray & Terry\'s Longevity Products, which sells supplements—under the umbrella of Kurzweil Technologies. The company takes up all of one floor and half of another in a nondescript office-park building in Wellesley Hills, Mass. In the reception area on the second floor is an antique Ediphone, one of Thomas Edison\'s dictation machines. On a table filled with plaques noting Kurzweil\'s achievements is a photo of him receiving the National Medal of Technology from President Clinton. There\'s a pipe-smoking mannequin with a ribbon that reads "I AM AN INVENTOR" on its chest. In the basement is a supercomputer processing millions of bits of market-related data. Kurzweil is hoping that FatKat will prove to be as spectacular an achievement as his early inventions, only a lot more lucrative. When describing his approach, he refers to the success of fellow MIT board member and hedge fund manager James Simons of Renaissance Technologies, whose $6 billion fund Medallion has averaged 36% returns annually after fees since 1988 and who, according to the hedge fund trade magazine Alpha, was the highest-paid hedgie last\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/ray-kurzweil-innovation-artificial-intelligence/\n\nSource 3:\nThe Snoo Sleeper was invented by pediatrician Harvey Karp <https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/harvey-karp-knows-how-to-make-babies-happy>, who is also the author of a parenting favorite, The Happiest Baby on the Block <https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/the-happiest-baby-book-paperback?pdp-price-comparison=true>. While the features of the Snoo Sleeper such as rocking your baby back to sleep and calming sounds undoubtedly make middle-of-the-night feedings and restlessness more comfortable for parents, the inspiration behind it <https://fortune.com/2021/02/13/snoo-responsive-bassinet-happiest-baby-smart-sleeper-sids-infant-mortality/> was actually to lessen the rate of SIDS-related deaths <https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-infant-death-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20352800>. SIDS, or sudden infant death syndrome, can occur when a baby rolls onto its stomach during sleep, and 3,400 babies die each year from the condition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/22/snoo-sleeper-bassinet-added-monthly-subscription-parents-mad/\n\nSource 4:\nHoback makes a brief half-hearted effort to assess if these candidates are Satoshi, and then moves on to Craig Wright <https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/01/25/craig-wright-bitcoin-satoshi-claim-legal-battle/>, an Australian charlatan who arrived on the crypto scene in 2016 with falsified <https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/> evidence to claim he invented Bitcoin. Mercifully, the filmmaker is not taken in and moves on to other candidates. As Money Electric progresses, it zeroes in first on Back as a potential Satoshi and then on Back’s Blockstream protégé and friend, Peter Todd.\n\nTodd is much younger than the other figures long identified as likely candidates, and would have been 19 or 20 years old at the time Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper. To make his case that Todd is Satoshi, Hoback seizes on his 2013 email exchange with an unknown figure named John Dillon about a technical upgrade to Bitcoin.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/10/08/who-invented-bitcoin-hbo-peter-todd/\n\nSource 5:\nLooking ahead, the most significant advancements in AI and other technologies will likely come not from those who invent entirely new concepts but from those who can refine and adapt existing ideas to meet new challenges. Tesla’s success wasn’t in creating the electric vehicle, but in transforming it into something desirable, scalable, and practical. Apple’s triumph wasn’t about inventing the smartphone or the personal computer—it was about making them accessible and indispensable.\n\nTrue innovation is measured not by where an idea starts, but by how it evolves, how it is improved, and how it transforms industries. The innovators we celebrate should include not only those who popularize ideas but also those who lay the foundations of these breakthroughs. Only by acknowledging this broader network of contributors can we fully appreciate how progress truly happens.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/controversy-ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-nobel-prize-tech/\n\nSource 5:\nArtificial intelligence follows a similar path. Hinton’s work was pivotal, but it stood on the shoulders of earlier research. Werbos and Amari’s contributions were critical to the development of neural network techniques that would later power breakthroughs like AlphaGo and OpenAI’s GPT. These technologies didn’t materialize out of thin air—they were the result of decades of incremental progress. Focusing too much on individual figures distorts the reality of technological advancement, which is nearly always a collaborative, multi-layered process.\n\nThis brings us to a fundamental truth about innovation: Being the first to develop an idea isn’t as important as being the one who refines, scales, and executes it effectively. Innovation is not about singular genius—it’s about collective progress. When we only credit the most visible figures, we miss the contributions of those who laid the groundwork for breakthroughs.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Hinton’s Nobel Prize should spark a reevaluation of how we recognize innovation. Werbos and Amari’s foundational work deserves greater recognition, as their early efforts were critical to enabling Hinton’s advances. Innovation is rarely the product of one person’s genius—it’s a collaborative journey built on incremental improvements over time.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/controversy-ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-nobel-prize-tech/\n\nSource 5:\nand Amari’s 1972 adaptive learning model <https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?q=Shun-Ichi+Amari+1972+adaptive+learning%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart> were crucial stepping stones, yet their efforts have largely been overshadowed by the visibility of later figures like Hinton.\nThe Nobel Prize—the highest honor in science—should recognize the full spectrum of contributions. The oversight in Hinton’s case reflects a broader misunderstanding of innovation itself. The myth of the lone genius, often epitomized by figures like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, dominates public narratives, leading us to believe that major breakthroughs occur in isolation. In reality, most advances result from cumulative, collaborative efforts. While Hinton’s recognition is deserved, it underscores a common flaw in how credit is distributed: The contributions of early pioneers often fade from view as those who build upon their work take the spotlight.\n\nThis is not a problem unique to AI. The history of technology is full of similar stories. Steve Jobs didn’t invent the iPhone from scratch. The iPhone was the product of incremental innovations in smartphones, just as the Macintosh borrowed heavily from innovations developed at Xerox <https://fortune.com/company/xerox/> PARC. Jobs’s brilliance lies in refining these technologies—making them intuitive and accessible to the masses. As Jobs himself admitted, “Good artists copy, great artists steal,” a nod to the reality that innovation often involves improving existing ideas rather than creating something entirely new.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/controversy-ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-nobel-prize-tech/\n\nSource 5:\nElon Musk’s association with Tesla <https://fortune.com/company/tesla/> offers another revealing example. Musk joined Tesla in 2004, years after it was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. While Musk is often credited with revolutionizing the electric vehicle industry, electric cars have existed for over a century. Musk’s genius wasn’t in inventing electric vehicles—it was in turning the concept into a desirable, scalable, and profitable product.

He grew up in Queens, New York, one of two children (he has a younger sister named Enid) of Fredric and Hannah Kurzweil, Viennese Jews who fled the Nazis in 1938. His parents encouraged their son\'s ambition. "Ideas were the religion of our household," he says. "They saw science and technology as the way of the future and a way to make money and not struggle the way they did." Fredric, a composer and conductor, died of heart disease at 58, an event that would have a lasting impact on his son. Kurzweil discovered computers at age 12, and quickly demonstrated an amazing facility with technology. At 14 he wangled a job as the computer programmer at the research department of Head Start, the federal government\'s early-childhood-development program. While there he wrote software that was later distributed by IBM <https://fortune.com/company/ibm/> (IBM) with its mainframes. At 17 he won an international science contest by building a computer that analyzed the works of Chopin and Beethoven to compose music; that trick landed him on the TV show\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/ray-kurzweil-innovation-artificial-intelligence/\n\nSource 2:\nThese days Kurzweil organizes his business interests—including FatKat and Ray & Terry\'s Longevity Products, which sells supplements—under the umbrella of Kurzweil Technologies. The company takes up all of one floor and half of another in a nondescript office-park building in Wellesley Hills, Mass. In the reception area on the second floor is an antique Ediphone, one of Thomas Edison\'s dictation machines.

There\'s a pipe-smoking mannequin with a ribbon that reads "I AM AN INVENTOR" on its chest. In the basement is a supercomputer processing millions of bits of market-related data. Kurzweil is hoping that FatKat will prove to be as spectacular an achievement as his early inventions, only a lot more lucrative. When describing his approach, he refers to the success of fellow MIT board member and hedge fund manager James Simons of Renaissance Technologies, whose $6 billion fund Medallion has averaged 36% returns annually after fees since 1988 and who, according to the hedge fund trade magazine Alpha, was the highest-paid hedgie last\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/ray-kurzweil-innovation-artificial-intelligence/\n\nSource 3:\nThe Snoo Sleeper was invented by pediatrician Harvey Karp <https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/harvey-karp-knows-how-to-make-babies-happy>, who is also the author of a parenting favorite, The Happiest Baby on the Block <https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/the-happiest-baby-book-paperback?pdp-price-comparison=true>.

Mercifully, the filmmaker is not taken in and moves on to other candidates. As Money Electric progresses, it zeroes in first on Back as a potential Satoshi and then on Back’s Blockstream protégé and friend, Peter Todd.\n\nTodd is much younger than the other figures long identified as likely candidates, and would have been 19 or 20 years old at the time Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper. To make his case that Todd is Satoshi, Hoback seizes on his 2013 email exchange with an unknown figure named John Dillon about a technical upgrade to Bitcoin.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/10/08/who-invented-bitcoin-hbo-peter-todd/\n\nSource 5:\nLooking ahead, the most significant advancements in AI and other technologies will likely come not from those who invent entirely new concepts but from those who can refine and adapt existing ideas to meet new challenges. Tesla’s success wasn’t in creating the electric vehicle, but in transforming it into something desirable, scalable, and practical. Apple’s triumph wasn’t about inventing the smartphone or the personal computer—it was about making them accessible and indispensable.\n\nTrue innovation is measured not by where an idea starts, but by how it evolves, how it is improved, and how it transforms industries. The innovators we celebrate should include not only those who popularize ideas but also those who lay the foundations of these breakthroughs. Only by acknowledging this broader network of contributors can we fully appreciate how progress truly happens.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/controversy-ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-nobel-prize-tech/\n\nSource 5:\nArtificial intelligence follows a similar path. Hinton’s work was pivotal, but it stood on the shoulders of earlier research. Werbos and Amari’s contributions were critical to the development of neural network techniques that would later power breakthroughs like AlphaGo and OpenAI’s GPT. These technologies didn’t materialize out of thin air—they were the result of decades of incremental progress. Focusing too much on individual figures distorts the reality of technological advancement, which is nearly always a collaborative, multi-layered process.\n\nThis brings us to a fundamental truth about innovation: Being the first to develop an idea isn’t as important as being the one who refines, scales, and executes it effectively. Innovation is not about singular genius—it’s about collective progress. When we only credit the most visible figures, we miss the contributions of those who laid the groundwork for breakthroughs.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Hinton’s Nobel Prize should spark a reevaluation of how we recognize innovation. Werbos and Amari’s foundational work deserves greater recognition, as their early efforts were critical to enabling Hinton’s advances. Innovation is rarely the product of one person’s genius—it’s a collaborative journey built on incremental improvements over time.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/controversy-ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-nobel-prize-tech/\n\nSource 5:\nand Amari’s 1972 adaptive learning model <https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?q=Shun-Ichi+Amari+1972+adaptive+learning%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart> were crucial stepping stones, yet their efforts have largely been overshadowed by the visibility of later figures like Hinton.\nThe Nobel Prize—the highest honor in science—should recognize the full spectrum of contributions. The oversight in Hinton’s case reflects a broader misunderstanding of innovation itself. The myth of the lone genius, often epitomized by figures like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, dominates public narratives, leading us to believe that major breakthroughs occur in isolation. In reality, most advances result from cumulative, collaborative efforts. While Hinton’s recognition is deserved, it underscores a common flaw in how credit is distributed: The contributions of early pioneers often fade from view as those who build upon their work take the spotlight.\n\nThis is not a problem unique to AI. The history of technology is full of similar stories. Steve Jobs didn’t invent the iPhone from scratch. The iPhone was the product of incremental innovations in smartphones, just as the Macintosh borrowed heavily from innovations developed at Xerox <https://fortune.com/company/xerox/> PARC. Jobs’s brilliance lies in refining these technologies—making them intuitive and accessible to the masses. As Jobs himself admitted, “Good artists copy, great artists steal,” a nod to the reality that innovation often involves improving existing ideas rather than creating something entirely new.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/controversy-ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-nobel-prize-tech/\n\nSource 5:\nElon Musk’s association with Tesla <https://fortune.com/company/tesla/> offers another revealing example. Musk joined Tesla in 2004, years after it was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. While Musk is often credited with revolutionizing the electric vehicle industry, electric cars have existed for over a century. Musk’s genius wasn’t in inventing electric vehicles—it was in turning the concept into a desirable, scalable, and profitable product. Tesla’s success came not from invention but from relentless execution and refinement, pushing boundaries in battery technology and autonomous driving.\n\nThis dynamic is central to Silicon Valley, where companies routinely build on existing ideas and take them to new heights.

The innovators we celebrate should include not only those who popularize ideas but also those who lay the foundations of these breakthroughs. Only by acknowledging this broader network of contributors can we fully appreciate how progress truly happens.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/controversy-ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-nobel-prize-tech/\n\nSource 5:\nArtificial intelligence follows a similar path. Hinton’s work was pivotal, but it stood on the shoulders of earlier research. Werbos and Amari’s contributions were critical to the development of neural network techniques that would later power breakthroughs like AlphaGo and OpenAI’s GPT. These technologies didn’t materialize out of thin air—they were the result of decades of incremental progress. Focusing too much on individual figures distorts the reality of technological advancement, which is nearly always a collaborative, multi-layered process.\n\nThis brings us to a fundamental truth about innovation: Being the first to develop an idea isn’t as important as being the one who refines, scales, and executes it effectively. Innovation is not about singular genius—it’s about collective progress. When we only credit the most visible figures, we miss the contributions of those who laid the groundwork for breakthroughs.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Hinton’s Nobel Prize should spark a reevaluation of how we recognize innovation. Werbos and Amari’s foundational work deserves greater recognition, as their early efforts were critical to enabling Hinton’s advances. Innovation is rarely the product of one person’s genius—it’s a collaborative journey built on incremental improvements over time.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/controversy-ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-nobel-prize-tech/\n\nSource 5:\nand Amari’s 1972 adaptive learning model <https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?q=Shun-Ichi+Amari+1972+adaptive+learning%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart> were crucial stepping stones, yet their efforts have largely been overshadowed by the visibility of later figures like Hinton.\nThe Nobel Prize—the highest honor in science—should recognize the full spectrum of contributions. The oversight in Hinton’s case reflects a broader misunderstanding of innovation itself. The myth of the lone genius, often epitomized by figures like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, dominates public narratives, leading us to believe that major breakthroughs occur in isolation. In reality, most advances result from cumulative, collaborative efforts. While Hinton’s recognition is deserved, it underscores a common flaw in how credit is distributed: The contributions of early pioneers often fade from view as those who build upon their work take the spotlight.\n\nThis is not a problem unique to AI. The history of technology is full of similar stories. Steve Jobs didn’t invent the iPhone from scratch. The iPhone was the product of incremental innovations in smartphones, just as the Macintosh borrowed heavily from innovations developed at Xerox <https://fortune.com/company/xerox/> PARC.

Musk joined Tesla in 2004, years after it was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. While Musk is often credited with revolutionizing the electric vehicle industry, electric cars have existed for over a century. Musk’s genius wasn’t in inventing electric vehicles—it was in turning the concept into a desirable, scalable, and profitable product. Tesla’s success came not from invention but from relentless execution and refinement, pushing boundaries in battery technology and autonomous driving.\n\nThis dynamic is central to Silicon Valley, where companies routinely build on existing ideas and take them to new heights.

He grew up in Queens, New York, one of two children (he has a younger sister named Enid) of Fredric and Hannah Kurzweil, Viennese Jews who fled the Nazis in 1938. His parents encouraged their son\'s ambition. "Ideas were the religion of our household," he says. "They saw science and technology as the way of the future and a way to make money and not struggle the way they did." Fredric, a composer and conductor, died of heart disease at 58, an event that would have a lasting impact on his son. Kurzweil discovered computers at age 12, and quickly demonstrated an amazing facility with technology. At 14 he wangled a job as the computer programmer at the research department of Head Start, the federal government\'s early-childhood-development program. While there he wrote software that was later distributed by IBM <https://fortune.com/company/ibm/> (IBM) with its mainframes. At 17 he won an international science contest by building a computer that analyzed the works of Chopin and Beethoven to compose music; that trick landed him on the TV show\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/ray-kurzweil-innovation-artificial-intelligence/\n\nSource 2:\nThese days Kurzweil organizes his business interests—including FatKat and Ray & Terry\'s Longevity Products, which sells supplements—under the umbrella of Kurzweil Technologies. The company takes up all of one floor and half of another in a nondescript office-park building in Wellesley Hills, Mass. In the reception area on the second floor is an antique Ediphone, one of Thomas Edison\'s dictation machines. On a table filled with plaques noting Kurzweil\'s achievements is a photo of him receiving the National Medal of Technology from President Clinton. There\'s a pipe-smoking mannequin with a ribbon that reads "I AM AN INVENTOR" on its chest. In the basement is a supercomputer processing millions of bits of market-related data. Kurzweil is hoping that FatKat will prove to be as spectacular an achievement as his early inventions, only a lot more lucrative. When describing his approach, he refers to the success of fellow MIT board member and hedge fund manager James Simons of Renaissance Technologies, whose $6 billion fund Medallion has averaged 36% returns annually after fees since 1988 and who, according to the hedge fund trade magazine Alpha, was the highest-paid hedgie last\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/ray-kurzweil-innovation-artificial-intelligence/\n\nSource 3:\nThe Snoo Sleeper was invented by pediatrician Harvey Karp <https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/harvey-karp-knows-how-to-make-babies-happy>, who is also the author of a parenting favorite, The Happiest Baby on the Block <https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/the-happiest-baby-book-paperback?pdp-price-comparison=true>.
