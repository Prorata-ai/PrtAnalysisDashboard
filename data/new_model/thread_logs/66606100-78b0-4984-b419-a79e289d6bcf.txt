The rise of the unemployment rate to 4.3% certainly seemed to spook investors. The new data from the Labor Department triggered the so-called Sahm Rule <https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/recession-indicator-claudia-sahm-rule-trigger-unemployment-rate-jobs-report/>, which indicates the likely start of a recession once the unemployment rate’s three-month moving average exceeds that measure’s lowest point over the trailing 12 months. “We completely flipped from a position where a weaker economy was bullish to [one where] a weaker economy is bearish,” said Jay Hatfield, the CEO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors. \n * Short-term traders drove a global sell-off. According to Hatfield, short-term investors like hedge funds sold in droves over the past two days. He thinks they are hesitant to stay long on stocks now that earnings season is over.

The July employment report came in far weaker than anticipated last week, with the U.S. economy adding 114,000 jobs, compared to economists’ consensus forecast for 175,000. The unemployment also rose to 4.3%, triggering one of the most accurate recession indicators, the infamous Sahm Rule.\n\n“The immediate implication is that investors fear that the economy may weaken rapidly and want the Fed to cut rates aggressively to maintain economic growth,” Wells Fargo’s Christopher explained. \n\nHowever, the global stock market rout began in Japan on Monday, where the Nikkei 225 plunged 12% in its worst day since 1987. And some say the so-called “carry trade” may be to blame for Japan’s dark Monday. \n\nFor years, traders have borrowed money in Japan, where interest rates are low, and then used that money to buy assets abroad.

Reports earlier this week said business activity in both the U.S. services and manufacturing sectors contracted last month, turning in weaker readings than economists expected. And U.S. shoppers at the lower end of the income spectrum <https://apnews.com/article/inflation-low-income-squeeze-profits-93d0614a3a0d0a93cf9e15e0985a7271> have been showing how difficult it is to keep up with still-rising prices, as balances owed on credit cards <https://apnews.com/article/credit-card-delinquency-nonprofit-counselor-c8197a70d38a3c5605f40fc1f4f775bb> swell.\n\n“What matters for long-term investors is whether fears of a recession become a reality,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “We think it’s unlikely we’ll see a recession this year or next, but that doesn’t mean the markets won’t fear one.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/05/stocks-near-records-wall-street-strong-jobs-report/\n\nSource 10:\nAlso weighing on the market have been worries about the slowing U.S. economy <https://apnews.com/article/economy-jobs-unemployment-federal-reserve-inflation-22095766804d9c1532b4fcc29565be49>. A raft of weaker-than-expected reports forced questions about whether the Federal Reserve <https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-federal-reserve-interest-rates-04d2877f47f3913acc2f992d8ef1581b> has kept interest rates <https://apnews.com/article/mortgage-rates-housing-interest-financing-home-loan-837101506a276eb78044fbd72771a479> at too high of an economy-crunching level for too long in order to beat inflation <https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-election-federal-reserve-rates-economy-d8d44ca753aace952831a8f0cb42b97c>.

Its latest reading for August sits at 0.57 pp.\n\nDraho admits that the labor market could prove to be the snag in America\'s return to an economic heyday, writing: "Cooling over the past six months has done more than just rebalance the labor market, it has left it looser than it was pre-pandemic."\n\n"The U.S. election and the escalating war in the Middle East are also sources of potential risks," adds Draho.\n\nOf course, the original Roaring ’20s had their end as well. The Great Depression kicked off with the Black Tuesday Wall Street stock market crash in October 1929.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/01/economy-roaring-20s-ubs-growth-unemployment-inflation/\n\nSource 12:\nUpcoming U.S. elections <https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-harris-election-b8340b9b1025df7c729377794a6a3131> could further scramble things: apart from the potential impact of policies that follow the vote, market gyrations could affect the election itself.\n\nA recession would likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive, but slower growth would sap inflation. That would oblige former President Donald Trump to focus on ways to revive the economy instead of focusing on higher prices.\n\nThe Bank of Japan’s move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero <https://apnews.com/article/japan-economy-rates-boj-yen-e00919b053412fabf7a800ed78a9ad7a> last week was another factor driving Monday\'s plunge in Tokyo.

The rise of the unemployment rate to 4.3% certainly seemed to spook investors. The new data from the Labor Department triggered the so-called Sahm Rule <https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/recession-indicator-claudia-sahm-rule-trigger-unemployment-rate-jobs-report/>, which indicates the likely start of a recession once the unemployment rate’s three-month moving average exceeds that measure’s lowest point over the trailing 12 months. “We completely flipped from a position where a weaker economy was bullish to [one where] a weaker economy is bearish,” said Jay Hatfield, the CEO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors. \n * Short-term traders drove a global sell-off. According to Hatfield, short-term investors like hedge funds sold in droves over the past two days. He thinks they are hesitant to stay long on stocks now that earnings season is over. That said: “We think the chance of recession remains extraordinarily low,” Hatfield said, “and the sell-off is irrational.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/stock-market-plunges-recession-fears/\n\nSource 5:\nAfter repeatedly surprising experts with its resilience, the U.S. economy has recently shown signs of a sharp slowdown. The July employment report came in far weaker than anticipated last week, with the U.S. economy adding 114,000 jobs, compared to economists’ consensus forecast for 175,000. The unemployment also rose to 4.3%, triggering one of the most accurate recession indicators, the infamous Sahm Rule.\n\n“The immediate implication is that investors fear that the economy may weaken rapidly and want the Fed to cut rates aggressively to maintain economic growth,” Wells Fargo’s Christopher explained. \n\nHowever, the global stock market rout began in Japan on Monday, where the Nikkei 225 plunged 12% in its worst day since 1987. And some say the so-called “carry trade” may be to blame for Japan’s dark Monday. \n\nFor years, traders have borrowed money in Japan, where interest rates are low, and then used that money to buy assets abroad.

If people lose their jobs, they stop spending, [and] more people lose jobs."\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street has had a more sanguine view of the economy, citing last year\'s widespread recession predictions that proved wrong as well as the AI boom that\'s helping to fuel a wave of investment and earnings growth.\n\nLast month, Neuberger Berman senior portfolio manager Steve Eisman also pointed to the boost in infrastructure spending.\n\n“We’re just powering through, and I think the only conclusion you can reach is that the U.S. economy is more dynamic than it’s ever been in its history,” he told CNBC <https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/13/big-short-investor-steve-eisman-the-u-s-economy-is-more-dynamic-than-its-ever-been.html>.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/recession-indicator-economic-outlook-sahm-rule-unemployment-rate-june-jobs-report/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/recession-indicator-economic-outlook-sahm-rule-unemployment-rate-june-jobs-report/\n\nSource 3:\nStill, recent trends in the labor market have looked weak at best, said Sahm, who is now chief economist at investment firm New Century Advisors.\n\n“It’s been very accurate over time, so that shouldn’t be dismissed,” she added, noting that “recessions can build slowly, and then come quickly.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/08/04/stock-market-crash-economic-outlook-recession-ai-fueled-bubble-fed-rate-cuts/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/04/stock-market-crash-economic-outlook-recession-ai-fueled-bubble-fed-rate-cuts/\n\nSource 4:\nWhat a way to end the week. The market plunged again Friday, with the Dow <https://fortune.com/company/dow/> closing down 600 points, the Nasdaq <https://fortune.com/company/nasdaq/> dropping 2.4% and the S&P off 6% from its recent all-time high. \n\nMarket watchers pointed to three main culprits for the swoon:\n* A weak <https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/unemployment-hiring-jobs-report-july/> jobs report reignited recession fears on Wall Street. The rise of the unemployment rate to 4.3% certainly seemed to spook investors. The new data from the Labor Department triggered the so-called Sahm Rule <https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/recession-indicator-claudia-sahm-rule-trigger-unemployment-rate-jobs-report/>, which indicates the likely start of a recession once the unemployment rate’s three-month moving average exceeds that measure’s lowest point over the trailing 12 months. “We completely flipped from a position where a weaker economy was bullish to [one where] a weaker economy is bearish,” said Jay Hatfield, the CEO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors. \n * Short-term traders drove a global sell-off. According to Hatfield, short-term investors like hedge funds sold in droves over the past two days. He thinks they are hesitant to stay long on stocks now that earnings season is over. That said: “We think the chance of recession remains extraordinarily low,” Hatfield said, “and the sell-off is irrational.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/stock-market-plunges-recession-fears/\n\nSource 5:\nAfter repeatedly surprising experts with its resilience, the U.S. economy has recently shown signs of a sharp slowdown. The July employment report came in far weaker than anticipated last week, with the U.S. economy adding 114,000 jobs, compared to economists’ consensus forecast for 175,000. The unemployment also rose to 4.3%, triggering one of the most accurate recession indicators, the infamous Sahm Rule.\n\n“The immediate implication is that investors fear that the economy may weaken rapidly and want the Fed to cut rates aggressively to maintain economic growth,” Wells Fargo’s Christopher explained. \n\nHowever, the global stock market rout began in Japan on Monday, where the Nikkei 225 plunged 12% in its worst day since 1987. And some say the so-called “carry trade” may be to blame for Japan’s dark Monday. \n\nFor years, traders have borrowed money in Japan, where interest rates are low, and then used that money to buy assets abroad. But with the Bank of Japan now raising interest rates last week, and most Western nations lowering interest rates, that trade isn’t what it used to be.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/global-stock-market-vix-fear-gauge-highest-level-2020/\n\nSource 6:\nUnlike venture capital <https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/vcs-are-unfazed-by-recession-jitters-heres-why/> (where I spend most of my time these days), real estate is incredibly sensitive to macroeconomic vicissitudes. And, in a week characterized by headline-snatching market volatility that\'s since receded <https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/wall-street-rebounds-as-sp-500-ends-3-day-slump/>, it was still worth asking: What would a theoretical recession mean for BiggerPockets and its users? \n\n"I will say, the crash already happened in the commercial real estate space, where you’ve seen a 30% peak to trough decline in asset values from 2021 to 2024," said Trench.

On Friday, Interactive Brokers senior economist José Torres pointed out that the yield curve has de-inverted <https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/traders-insight/securities/macro/jobs-friday-unlocks-painful-de-inversion/>, which has preceded every recession since 1976.\n\nAn inversion—where short-term yields top long-term yields—has been a reliable recession indicator as it signals that investors see more risk in the near future. \n\nYields were inverted for about two years until recently, but their de-inversion doesn’t mean the economy is in the clear.\n\n“Indeed, a positive spread across the two- and 10-year Treasury maturities following a long period of a negative difference has historically preceded economic downturns,” Torres warned.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/07/recession-indicator-job-market-private-sector-payrolls-economic-outlook-downturn/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/07/recession-indicator-job-market-private-sector-payrolls-economic-outlook-downturn/\n\nSource 9:\nFriday’s jobs report follows a mass of data showing a slowdown across the U.S. economy. Reports earlier this week said business activity in both the U.S. services and manufacturing sectors contracted last month, turning in weaker readings than economists expected. And U.S. shoppers at the lower end of the income spectrum <https://apnews.com/article/inflation-low-income-squeeze-profits-93d0614a3a0d0a93cf9e15e0985a7271> have been showing how difficult it is to keep up with still-rising prices, as balances owed on credit cards <https://apnews.com/article/credit-card-delinquency-nonprofit-counselor-c8197a70d38a3c5605f40fc1f4f775bb> swell.\n\n“What matters for long-term investors is whether fears of a recession become a reality,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “We think it’s unlikely we’ll see a recession this year or next, but that doesn’t mean the markets won’t fear one.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/05/stocks-near-records-wall-street-strong-jobs-report/\n\nSource 10:\nAlso weighing on the market have been worries about the slowing U.S. economy <https://apnews.com/article/economy-jobs-unemployment-federal-reserve-inflation-22095766804d9c1532b4fcc29565be49>. A raft of weaker-than-expected reports forced questions about whether the Federal Reserve <https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-federal-reserve-interest-rates-04d2877f47f3913acc2f992d8ef1581b> has kept interest rates <https://apnews.com/article/mortgage-rates-housing-interest-financing-home-loan-837101506a276eb78044fbd72771a479> at too high of an economy-crunching level for too long in order to beat inflation <https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-election-federal-reserve-rates-economy-d8d44ca753aace952831a8f0cb42b97c>.

Its latest reading for August sits at 0.57 pp.\n\nDraho admits that the labor market could prove to be the snag in America\'s return to an economic heyday, writing: "Cooling over the past six months has done more than just rebalance the labor market, it has left it looser than it was pre-pandemic."\n\n"The U.S. election and the escalating war in the Middle East are also sources of potential risks," adds Draho.\n\nOf course, the original Roaring ’20s had their end as well. The Great Depression kicked off with the Black Tuesday Wall Street stock market crash in October 1929.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/01/economy-roaring-20s-ubs-growth-unemployment-inflation/\n\nSource 12:\nUpcoming U.S. elections <https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-harris-election-b8340b9b1025df7c729377794a6a3131> could further scramble things: apart from the potential impact of policies that follow the vote, market gyrations could affect the election itself.\n\nA recession would likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive, but slower growth would sap inflation. That would oblige former President Donald Trump to focus on ways to revive the economy instead of focusing on higher prices.\n\nThe Bank of Japan’s move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero <https://apnews.com/article/japan-economy-rates-boj-yen-e00919b053412fabf7a800ed78a9ad7a> last week was another factor driving Monday\'s plunge in Tokyo. Higher rates can boost the value of the Japanese yen, but oblige traders to scramble out of deals where they had borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nOn Tuesday, the dollar was worth 145.33 yen, up from 144.17 yen late Monday.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/08/06/japan-nikkei-index-recovers-from-worst-plunge-since-1987/'}

2024-11-07 23:12:41,788: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that lead to a slowdown in economic growth. According to Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, "It comes down to jobs" [1]. Jobs drive spending by U.S. consumers, which in turn is the biggest part of the U.S. economy. When people lose their jobs, they stop spending, and more people lose jobs, creating a vicious cycle [2]. This dynamic can feed on itself, leading to a recession.

Another factor that can contribute to a recession is a slowdown in industrial production. In Germany, for example

2024-11-07 23:12:42,261: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that lead to a slowdown in economic growth. According to Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, "It comes down to jobs" [1]. Jobs drive spending by U.S. consumers, which in turn is the biggest part of the U.S. economy. When people lose their jobs, they stop spending, and more people lose jobs, creating a vicious cycle [2]. This dynamic can feed on itself, leading to a recession.

Another factor that can contribute to a recession is a slowdown in industrial production. In Germany, for example, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector, amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7]. Additionally, the car industry's difficulties in pivoting to electric vehicles have also had an impact on production [7]. When industrial production slows down, it can have a ripple effect

2024-11-07 23:12:42,446: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that lead to a slowdown in economic growth. According to Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, "It comes down to jobs" [1]. Jobs drive spending by U.S. consumers, which in turn is the biggest part of the U.S. economy. When people lose their jobs, they stop spending, and more people lose jobs, creating a vicious cycle [2]. This dynamic can feed on itself, leading to a recession.

Another factor that can contribute to a recession is a slowdown in industrial production. In Germany, for example, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector, amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7]. Additionally, the car industry's difficulties in pivoting to electric vehicles have also had an impact on production [7]. When industrial production slows down, it can have a ripple effect on the entire economy, leading to a recession.

Recessions can also be triggered by a combination of macroeconomic factors, such as high interest

Additionally, the car industry's difficulties in pivoting to electric vehicles have also had an impact on production [7]. When industrial production slows down, it can have a ripple effect on the entire economy, leading to a recession.

Recessions can also be triggered by a combination of macroeconomic factors, such as high interest rates, inflation, and a decline in business activity. For instance, the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates high for too long

When people lose their jobs, they stop spending, and more people lose jobs, creating a vicious cycle [2]. This dynamic can feed on itself, leading to a recession.

According to Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, "It comes down to jobs" [1]. Jobs drive spending by U.S. consumers, which in turn is the biggest part of the U.S. economy. When people lose their jobs, they stop spending, and more people lose jobs, creating a vicious cycle [2]. This dynamic can feed on itself, leading to a recession.

Another factor that can contribute to a recession is a slowdown in industrial production. In Germany, for example, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector, amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7]. Additionally, the car industry's difficulties in pivoting to electric vehicles have also had an impact on production [7]. When industrial production slows down, it can have a ripple effect on the entire economy, leading to a recession.

Recessions can also be triggered by a combination of macroeconomic factors, such as high interest rates, inflation, and a decline in business activity. For instance, the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates high for too long can lead to a slowdown in the economy [10]. Similarly, a decline in business activity, as seen in the U.S. services and manufacturing sectors, can also contribute to a recession [9]. Furthermore, a rise in unemployment rates,

Furthermore, a rise in unemployment rates, as seen in the July employment report, can also trigger a recession [4].

2024-11-07 23:12:43,070: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why do economic recessions occur?

2024-11-07 23:12:43,070: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that lead to a slowdown in economic growth. According to Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, "It comes down to jobs" [1]. Jobs drive spending by U.S. consumers, which in turn is the biggest part of the U.S. economy. When people lose their jobs, they stop spending, and more people lose jobs, creating a vicious cycle [2]. This dynamic can feed on itself, leading to a recession.

Another factor that can contribute to a recession is a slowdown in industrial production. In Germany, for example, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector, amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7]. Additionally, the car industry's difficulties in pivoting to electric vehicles have also had an impact on production [7]. When industrial production slows down, it can have a ripple effect on the entire economy, leading to a recession.

Recessions can also be triggered by a combination of macroeconomic factors, such as high interest rates, inflation, and a decline in business activity. For instance, the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates high for too long can lead to a slowdown in the economy [10]. Similarly, a decline in business activity, as seen in the U.S. services and manufacturing sectors, can also contribute to a recession [9]. Furthermore, a rise in unemployment rates, as seen in the July employment report, can also trigger a recession [4].
