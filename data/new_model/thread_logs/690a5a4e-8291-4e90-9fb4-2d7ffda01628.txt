Which means neither of us were dreaming of living in the suburbs, but ironically our life is now very classic suburbia, living in a house just south of Aarhus, Denmark’s second biggest city.

A swanky apartment in the city or a suburban sprawling?\n\nI used to live in downtown Boston, and I loved it. Those morning walks strolling through the city on my way to work grabbing a coffee on the go were something else. My wife, on the other hand, has always had a dream of living in the countryside. Which means neither of us were dreaming of living in the suburbs, but ironically our life is now very classic suburbia, living in a house just south of Aarhus, Denmark’s second biggest city. It might not be where we pictured ourselves years ago, but it works really well with kids having the school just down the street and friends nearby.
