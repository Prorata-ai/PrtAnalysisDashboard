It’s hard to imagine that Kamala Harris or Donald Trump would tell that to a business leader or anyone else, but it might be instructive to hear what they would say.\n\nMore broadly, would Harris and Trump answer all these questions candidly, even to a business leader? We may never know, but in any case it’s fitting to remember a quote from a great economist, Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson: “Politicians like to tell people what they want to hear—and what they want to hear is what won't happen.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/14/harris-trump-economic-plans-tariffs-china-policy/>", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.61285245), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='3b062b61-c120-42ca-9060-b6fcc6fc13ab', embedding=None, metadata={'id': '369a0673f2c1604eee4f67b44c25c4a1093e483536b0d734e1dd2f4e07103267-2', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': '369a0673f2c1604eee4f67b44c25c4a1093e483536b0d734e1dd2f4e07103267', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20240517, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-07', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151325607-e1715948274656.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2024, 'date_month': 5, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/17/big-tech-pouring-billions-london-ai-investments-uk-sidekick-us-tech-giants/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 17, 'title': 'Big Tech is pouring billions into British AI investments—but the U.K. risks becoming a sidekick to U.S. tech giants', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/17/big-tech-pouring-billions-london-ai-investments-uk-sidekick-us-tech-giants/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='So why is it that with all this talent, our attention seems to constantly be on moves made by companies and capital from overseas, rather than focusing on building and keeping our own tech ventures, and turning them into the world players they could be?\n\nThe fact that we herald the likes of Microsoft further embedding themselves into the fabric of U.K. tech surely begs the question as to why, as a nation, we haven’t cracked the code for building tech heavyweights of our own. \n\nOur universities are very capable of creating spinouts, the funding environment is conducive for raising, and early-stage venture capital is accessible.

It is the most consequential election in a year of very consequential elections. At the time of writing, some 72 million Americans have cast their ballots <https://election.lab.ufl.edu/early-vote/2024-early-voting/>—about 45% of the total that will be submitted. We are trailing the 2020 tally, but well ahead of 2016. This is America’s democracy in action.\n\nThe polls show a neck-and-neck race at the national level and in the seven key swing states. It is hard to say who holds the lead. At Ipsos, we give a slight edge to former President Donald Trump but have a low level of conviction about the outcome given the mixed signals. Such a close race is the clearest manifestation of a divided and polarized America—it\'s a tale of two Americas.\n\nThis begets the critical question: Will America withstand such a razor-thin outcome?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/11/04/top-pollsters-warn-potential-chaos-no-matter-wins-election-margins-razor-thin-trust-trump-harris-presidential-politics/\n\nSource 3:\nIn every survey there are found outcroppings of people who don\'t give the right answers -- i.e. answers that are reasonable according to any rule of logic. Sometimes when their answers are cross-tabulated they are discovered in startling contradictions. More often, though, they support an impossible position with cold logic. Always they are too few to be anything more than a statistical curiosity. Yet, when they represent even 1 percent, they speak for over 750,000 baffling adults. But these mavericks (let us call them) are otherwise evidently normal people. They almost always come from every level of society, are drawn from as many occupations as are tabulated. And they do, in their own peculiar ways, think with an admirable consistency. In this installment the maverick can be spotted by his answers to two simple questions. They are the 2.1 percent who deny that the government should maintain an army and navy, and the 3.8 percent who deny that there should be any federal postal services. On both questions they constitute about the same percentage of the prosperous as they do of the Negroes.

Why do you think Pacaso may be more appealing than Airbnb <https://fortune.com/company/airbnb/> when choosing vacation spots?\n\nI think Airbnb is an amazing solution for someone who\'s only visiting a location once a year. But if you live in San Francisco, for example, and you\'re gonna go to Napa, or Lake Tahoe, multiple times throughout the year, Airbnb doesn\'t solve that problem really well. \n\nPacaso solves that problem really well, because you own the home, which means you get to leave your stuff in the home, you\'re guaranteed all the right times throughout the year in your home. You get to participate in the capital appreciation as that home goes up in value. So it really just comes down to usage. For very frequent usage, it\'s better to buy the whole home. But if you\'re using a place two to 10 times per year, that\'s where Pacaso is optimal. \n\nHow does leaving your stuff in Pacaso homes work when you\'re sharing it with other owners?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/06/austin-allison-pacaso-dotloop-zillow-career-life-how-i-made-my-first-million/\n\nSource 5:\nPerhaps for that reason, it is the amazing contention of some in the financial world that derivatives sailed quite smoothly through the financial crisis. One banker said recently that the derivatives problem at AIG <https://fortune.com/company/aig/> was mainly that management wasn\'t paying attention.\n\nThis article will present a different view. We\'ll start with reminders of how derivatives contributed to the collapse of Bear Stearns and AIG, in the process delivering a large, and detested, bill to the U.S. taxpayer. We\'ll also go behind the scenes of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers, whose 900,000 derivatives contracts are proving once again that the sheer complexity of these instruments is itself an enormous problem. So is regulating them, which does not mean we shouldn\'t be trying.\n\nA basic reason for favoring regulation is that derivatives create a kind of mirage. They don\'t extinguish risk, they simply transfer it to a different party—a counterparty, as the term goes. The ultimate outcome is millions of contracts and an endless, virtually unmapped, web of connections among financial institutions. That maze exists today, and so does the systemic threat it raises: that some major counterparty will go bust and drag down other institutions to which it is linked.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/derivatives-the-risk-that-still-wont-go-away-fortune-2009/\n\nSource 6:\nThe common thread with all these answers is that they duck the direct questions they’re asked. It reminds me of when I used to write chemistry lab reports in high school. Did I particularly understand valence electrons? No, but could I write around it enough that if I was lucky the teacher didn’t notice? Yes. But ChatGPT isn’t 16-year-old me, trying to get a good grade so I could get into college (though some kids trying to get into college may unfortunately be using ChatGPT). \n\nPerhaps this is a guardrail designed to prevent wild hallucinations. Instead of inventing something out of whole cloth, the AI serves up a bunch of other information that may not perfectly answer the question but is at least not demonstrably false. If that’s the case though, why can’t a chatbot just say: Nope, sorry, don’t have the answer. \n\nAt a time when there are a lot of unanswered questions about how much AI can be trusted and what it means to regulate the technology, these results highlight a strange problem: How do you make sure the AI not only doesn’t serve up the wrong information, but also offers the right information?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/13/friday-the-13th-ai-hallucinations/\n\nSource 7:\nFor me, there was one question that should have kicked off the debate: Does Vance believe the results of the 2020 election were valid? He did not answer because he can’t. Despite every governor and every court stating clearly that democracy prevailed in the last election, this is a man who will not do what his predecessor Mike Pence did when confronted with a president who wants to stage a coup: say no. Having lived in countries ruled by dictators, where corruption and cruelty often go unchecked, that’s the question that haunts me.\n\nTrue power is earned.

Finally, you think you’ve won over the hiring manager when they ask, “when can you start?” \n\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking the right answer, is “straight away.” After all, you want to seem eager. \n\nBut be warned: Shapiro says being available within two weeks is a big red flag that could land you in the rejection pile. “They don’t get the job, because they’ll treat us the way they treat that former employer,” Shapiro recently told CNBC.\n\n“I want an [employee] with a level of commitment to their organization—even if they don’t love their job—where they won’t leave their employer hanging.”\n\nUnless, of course, you’re unemployed—in which case, the pass-fail question doesn’t apply.\n\nFortune has contacted Gary Shapiro for comment.\n\nThe loyalty test applies to exiting employees too\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/11/01/ceo-rejects-job-candidates-who-start-right-away/\n\nSource 9:\nof algebra to represent thinking processes, which are by no means random, yet not entirely methodical.

Beijing said so in 2020 when former President Donald Trump was trying to make that sale happen. It said so again last year when the Biden administration was floating the idea. And again last month <https://www.wsj.com/tech/tiktok-ban-chinese-owners-bytedance-1a857a06>, after the House passed the current bill.\nSo if Mnuchin, Kotick, or whoever does manage to get their hands on the hottest social network of our times, it would likely come without the secret sauce that makes TikTok so popular.

More broadly, the Government Accountability Office says the growing national debt is unsustainable. How will you return America to fiscal responsibility?\n\nWhy this question: This is the hardest one. Any remedy for Washington’s bipartisan profligate spending will be painful, and no aspiring President wants to announce pain.

One banker said recently that the derivatives problem at AIG <https://fortune.com/company/aig/> was mainly that management wasn\'t paying attention.\n\nThis article will present a different view. We\'ll start with reminders of how derivatives contributed to the collapse of Bear Stearns and AIG, in the process delivering a large, and detested, bill to the U.S. taxpayer. We\'ll also go behind the scenes of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers, whose 900,000 derivatives contracts are proving once again that the sheer complexity of these instruments is itself an enormous problem. So is regulating them, which does not mean we shouldn\'t be trying.\n\nA basic reason for favoring regulation is that derivatives create a kind of mirage. They don\'t extinguish risk, they simply transfer it to a different party—a counterparty, as the term goes. The ultimate outcome is millions of contracts and an endless, virtually unmapped, web of connections among financial institutions. That maze exists today, and so does the systemic threat it raises: that some major counterparty will go bust and drag down other institutions to which it is linked.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/derivatives-the-risk-that-still-wont-go-away-fortune-2009/\n\nSource 6:\nThe common thread with all these answers is that they duck the direct questions they’re asked.

But ChatGPT isn’t 16-year-old me, trying to get a good grade so I could get into college (though some kids trying to get into college may unfortunately be using ChatGPT). \n\nPerhaps this is a guardrail designed to prevent wild hallucinations. Instead of inventing something out of whole cloth, the AI serves up a bunch of other information that may not perfectly answer the question but is at least not demonstrably false.

Beijing said so in 2020 when former President Donald Trump was trying to make that sale happen. It said so again last year when the Biden administration was floating the idea.

However, the capital required for these companies to continue growing and being capable of challenging the best tech businesses worldwide simply doesn’t exist.

It is the most consequential election in a year of very consequential elections. At the time of writing, some 72 million Americans have cast their ballots <https://election.lab.ufl.edu/early-vote/2024-early-voting/>—about 45% of the total that will be submitted. We are trailing the 2020 tally, but well ahead of 2016. This is America’s democracy in action.\n\nThe polls show a neck-and-neck race at the national level and in the seven key swing states. It is hard to say who holds the lead. At Ipsos, we give a slight edge to former President Donald Trump but have a low level of conviction about the outcome given the mixed signals. Such a close race is the clearest manifestation of a divided and polarized America—it\'s a tale of two Americas.\n\nThis begets the critical question: Will America withstand such a razor-thin outcome?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/11/04/top-pollsters-warn-potential-chaos-no-matter-wins-election-margins-razor-thin-trust-trump-harris-presidential-politics/\n\nSource 3:\nIn every survey there are found outcroppings of people who don\'t give the right answers -- i.e. answers that are reasonable according to any rule of logic. Sometimes when their answers are cross-tabulated they are discovered in startling contradictions. More often, though, they support an impossible position with cold logic. Always they are too few to be anything more than a statistical curiosity. Yet, when they represent even 1 percent, they speak for over 750,000 baffling adults. But these mavericks (let us call them) are otherwise evidently normal people. They almost always come from every level of society, are drawn from as many occupations as are tabulated. And they do, in their own peculiar ways, think with an admirable consistency. In this installment the maverick can be spotted by his answers to two simple questions. They are the 2.1 percent who deny that the government should maintain an army and navy, and the 3.8 percent who deny that there should be any federal postal services. On both questions they constitute about the same percentage of the prosperous as they do of the Negroes. Take for example the anti postal group: they are usually surer of their opinions on other forms of government services -- indicated by fewer\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/how-much-government-do-americans-want-fortune-classics-1939/\n\nSource 4:\nOn the opposite side of timeshares are Airbnbs. Why do you think Pacaso may be more appealing than Airbnb <https://fortune.com/company/airbnb/> when choosing vacation spots?\n\nI think Airbnb is an amazing solution for someone who\'s only visiting a location once a year. But if you live in San Francisco, for example, and you\'re gonna go to Napa, or Lake Tahoe, multiple times throughout the year, Airbnb doesn\'t solve that problem really well. \n\nPacaso solves that problem really well, because you own the home, which means you get to leave your stuff in the home, you\'re guaranteed all the right times throughout the year in your home. You get to participate in the capital appreciation as that home goes up in value. So it really just comes down to usage. For very frequent usage, it\'s better to buy the whole home. But if you\'re using a place two to 10 times per year, that\'s where Pacaso is optimal. \n\nHow does leaving your stuff in Pacaso homes work when you\'re sharing it with other owners?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/06/austin-allison-pacaso-dotloop-zillow-career-life-how-i-made-my-first-million/\n\nSource 5:\nPerhaps for that reason, it is the amazing contention of some in the financial world that derivatives sailed quite smoothly through the financial crisis. One banker said recently that the derivatives problem at AIG <https://fortune.com/company/aig/> was mainly that management wasn\'t paying attention.\n\nThis article will present a different view. We\'ll start with reminders of how derivatives contributed to the collapse of Bear Stearns and AIG, in the process delivering a large, and detested, bill to the U.S. taxpayer. We\'ll also go behind the scenes of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers, whose 900,000 derivatives contracts are proving once again that the sheer complexity of these instruments is itself an enormous problem. So is regulating them, which does not mean we shouldn\'t be trying.\n\nA basic reason for favoring regulation is that derivatives create a kind of mirage. They don\'t extinguish risk, they simply transfer it to a different party—a counterparty, as the term goes. The ultimate outcome is millions of contracts and an endless, virtually unmapped, web of connections among financial institutions. That maze exists today, and so does the systemic threat it raises: that some major counterparty will go bust and drag down other institutions to which it is linked.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/derivatives-the-risk-that-still-wont-go-away-fortune-2009/\n\nSource 6:\nThe common thread with all these answers is that they duck the direct questions they’re asked. It reminds me of when I used to write chemistry lab reports in high school. Did I particularly understand valence electrons? No, but could I write around it enough that if I was lucky the teacher didn’t notice? Yes. But ChatGPT isn’t 16-year-old me, trying to get a good grade so I could get into college (though some kids trying to get into college may unfortunately be using ChatGPT). \n\nPerhaps this is a guardrail designed to prevent wild hallucinations. Instead of inventing something out of whole cloth, the AI serves up a bunch of other information that may not perfectly answer the question but is at least not demonstrably false. If that’s the case though, why can’t a chatbot just say: Nope, sorry, don’t have the answer. \n\nAt a time when there are a lot of unanswered questions about how much AI can be trusted and what it means to regulate the technology, these results highlight a strange problem: How do you make sure the AI not only doesn’t serve up the wrong information, but also offers the right information?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/13/friday-the-13th-ai-hallucinations/\n\nSource 7:\nFor me, there was one question that should have kicked off the debate: Does Vance believe the results of the 2020 election were valid? He did not answer because he can’t. Despite every governor and every court stating clearly that democracy prevailed in the last election, this is a man who will not do what his predecessor Mike Pence did when confronted with a president who wants to stage a coup: say no. Having lived in countries ruled by dictators, where corruption and cruelty often go unchecked, that’s the question that haunts me.\n\nTrue power is earned.
