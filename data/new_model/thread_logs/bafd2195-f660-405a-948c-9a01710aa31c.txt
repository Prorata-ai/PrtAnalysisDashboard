"...Suppose when we get to the moon we find sitting in the middle of a crater a strange little marker bearing a carefully chiseled but totally incomprehensible inscription," one scientist told Fortune writer Bello; "Then space would really get exciting." By Francis Bello Anyone who has wondered what it was like to live in the era that followed Columbus\' voyage to America now has his chance to find out. Then, as now, thoughtful men disputed the merits of pressing into the unknown, argued that the possible fruits could not justify the cost, warned that the hazards to life and limb were immense. And then as now, the young, the venturesome, and the insatiably curious plunged ahead.

In the twenty-one months of the new age, the White House, Congress, and the U.S. public have had quite an education. When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled "Introduction to Outer Space," prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, "This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists." This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact. Since the testimony, running to more than 600 pages, is the most complete account yet given of NASA\'s program, some of its highlights are worth recording here.

Scientists will, of course, get answers to questions of the sort that they know how to ask: What gases are in the atmospheres of other planets? What elements are in their crusts? Are radioactive elements more or less abundant than on earth, and what will they tell us about the ages of other planets? But beyond all this there will certainly be extraordinary surprises.

By Francis Bello Anyone who has wondered what it was like to live in the era that followed Columbus\' voyage to America now has his chance to find out. Then, as now, thoughtful men disputed the merits of pressing into the unknown, argued that the possible fruits could not justify the cost, warned that the hazards to life and limb were immense. And then as now, the young, the venturesome, and the insatiably curious plunged ahead.

In the twenty-one months of the new age, the White House, Congress, and the U.S. public have had quite an education. When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled "Introduction to Outer Space," prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, "This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists." This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact. Since the testimony, running to more than 600 pages, is the most complete account yet given of NASA\'s program, some of its highlights are worth recording here.

In the twenty-one months of the new age, the White House, Congress, and the U.S. public have had quite an education. When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled "Introduction to Outer Space," prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, "This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists." This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact.

When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled "Introduction to Outer Space," prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, "This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists." This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact. Since the testimony, running to more than 600 pages, is the most complete account yet given of NASA\'s program, some of its highlights are worth recording here.

Companies were starting to build the crafts that would enable U.S. astronauts to fly. Then as now, scientists and government officials debated the costs and benefits of space travel and the possibility of discovering life. "...Suppose when we get to the moon we find sitting in the middle of a crater a strange little marker bearing a carefully chiseled but totally incomprehensible inscription," one scientist told Fortune writer Bello; "Then space would really get exciting." By Francis Bello Anyone who has wondered what it was like to live in the era that followed Columbus\' voyage to America now has his chance to find out. Then, as now, thoughtful men disputed the merits of pressing into the unknown, argued that the possible fruits could not justify the cost, warned that the hazards to life and limb were immense. And then as now, the young, the venturesome, and the insatiably curious plunged ahead.

In the twenty-one months of the new age, the White House, Congress, and the U.S. public have had quite an education. When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled "Introduction to Outer Space," prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, "This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists." This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact. Since the testimony, running to more than 600 pages, is the most complete account yet given of NASA\'s program, some of its highlights are worth recording here. Mapping and cloud hunting During the rest of 1959 and 1960, NASA expects to fire a total of nearly 150 sounding rockets to gather detailed information on the earth\'s\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-early-space-age-fortune-1959/\n\nSource 1:\nIn the middle of a crater As to what it may find in its cosmic journeys, NASA has no clearer idea than anyone else. Scientists will, of course, get answers to questions of the sort that they know how to ask: What gases are in the atmospheres of other planets? What elements are in their crusts? Are radioactive elements more or less abundant than on earth, and what will they tell us about the ages of other planets? But beyond all this there will certainly be extraordinary surprises. One Rand Corporation scientist likes to indulge in this fantasy: "Just to explore chunks of lifeless rock isn\'t going to mean much to many people," he points out, "but suppose when we get to the moon we find sitting in the middle of a crater a strange little marker bearing a carefully chiseled but totally incomprehensible inscription. Then space would really get exciting. We would know we weren\'t alone in the universe, and that\'s really what we\'re trying to find out."\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-early-space-age-fortune-1959/\n\nSource 2:\nAmerica’s first Black astronaut candidate finally rocketed into space 60 years later, flying with Jeff Bezos’ rocket company <https://apnews.com/article/jeff-bezos-space-e0afeaa813ff0bdf23c37fe16fd34265> on Sunday.\n\nEd Dwight <https://apnews.com/article/nasa-space-race-ed-dwight-9e87955f10331a2c32ecab6ca033a4af> was an Air Force pilot when President John F.

But he wasn\'t chosen for the 1963 class, which included eventual Gemini and Apollo astronauts, including Apollo 11’s Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. NASA didn’t select Black astronauts until 1978, and Guion Bluford became the first African American in space in 1983. Three years earlier, the Soviets launched the first Black astronaut, Arnaldo Tamayo Mendez, a Cuban of African descent.\n\nAfter leaving the military in 1966, Dwight joined IBM <https://fortune.com/company/ibm/> and started a construction company, before earning a master\'s degree in sculpture in the late 1970s. He\'s since dedicated himself to art. His sculptures focus on Black history and include memorials and monuments across the country.

The notion of a tower <https://www.isec.org/history> that could extend from Earth thousands of miles into space was suggested in 1895 by a Russian scientist and astronautics pioneer, Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky. At that time, one of the strongest and most widely used construction materials in the world was steel, and so for a variety of reasons–too heavy and not strong enough—the concept remained a thought exercise.\n\nFor the longest time, the material engineering question—how to make strong enough ribbon or cable—remained elusive. But the discovery <https://fortune.com/company/discovery-insurance/> in 1991 of carbon nanotubes, with strength far surpassing steel and other materials, took the notion of a space elevator from distant to plausible.\n\n“It surprised me that somebody hadn’t dumped a ton of money into carbon nanotubes, because carbon nanotubes are an absolute game changer,” says Edwards. “They’re easily 20 to 30 times stronger than carbon fiber (Kevlar) and anything else. They would revolutionize a lot of industries.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 7:\nAt 17, Larsen Jensen was on the cover of Swimming World magazine, with the headline “The Next Great American Distance Star?” \n\nI don’t usually approve of question marks in headlines, but, in this case, the punctuation acknowledged a reality—that there were astonishingly high expectations that would be hard for anyone, let alone a small-town teenager, to meet. Jensen loved pizza and Zoolander, and spent the little free time he had with friends or on the computer. But he\'d also just done the seemingly impossible, breaking the long-standing American men\'s 800 meter freestyle record. The 2003 article proved prescient. The following summer in Athens, Jensen won an Olympic silver medal in the demanding 1500 meter freestyle, beaten only by legendary Australian swimmer Grant Hackett.\n\n“Nobody ever goes to the Olympics trying to win a silver medal,” said Jensen. “Everyone’s trying for the gold. So, obviously, I’d have preferred to have the American National Anthem playing, but that wasn’t in the cards. And I went the distance with Grant, who in context was really my hero.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/what-links-olympic-swimmers-and-startup-founders-swimmer-vc-larsen-jensen/\n\nSource 8:\nThe young man was pacing around the edges of the Donald Trump <https://fortune.com/2024/07/18/jd-vance-trumps-vp-nominee-rust-belt-upbringing/> campaign rally, shouldering a big backpack and peering into the lens of a rangefinder toward the rooftops behind the stage where the former president would stand within the hour.\n\nHis behavior was so odd, so unlike that of the other rallygoers, that local law enforcement took notice, radioed their concerns and snapped a photo. But then he vanished.\n\nThe image was circulated by officers stationed outside the security perimeter on that hot, sunny Saturday afternoon <https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-trump-assassination-attempt-city-8c62803f8a57f569a2a5639172a6c783>.

In the twenty-one months of the new age, the White House, Congress, and the U.S. public have had quite an education. When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled "Introduction to Outer Space," prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, "This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists." This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact. Since the testimony, running to more than 600 pages, is the most complete account yet given of NASA\'s program, some of its highlights are worth recording here. Mapping and cloud hunting During the rest of 1959 and 1960, NASA expects to fire a total of nearly 150 sounding rockets to gather detailed information on the earth\'s\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-early-space-age-fortune-1959/\n\nSource 1:\nIn the middle of a crater As to what it may find in its cosmic journeys, NASA has no clearer idea than anyone else. Scientists will, of course, get answers to questions of the sort that they know how to ask: What gases are in the atmospheres of other planets? What elements are in their crusts? Are radioactive elements more or less abundant than on earth, and what will they tell us about the ages of other planets? But beyond all this there will certainly be extraordinary surprises. One Rand Corporation scientist likes to indulge in this fantasy: "Just to explore chunks of lifeless rock isn\'t going to mean much to many people," he points out, "but suppose when we get to the moon we find sitting in the middle of a crater a strange little marker bearing a carefully chiseled but totally incomprehensible inscription.

One Rand Corporation scientist likes to indulge in this fantasy: "Just to explore chunks of lifeless rock isn\'t going to mean much to many people," he points out, "but suppose when we get to the moon we find sitting in the middle of a crater a strange little marker bearing a carefully chiseled but totally incomprehensible inscription.

The notion of a tower <https://www.isec.org/history> that could extend from Earth thousands of miles into space was suggested in 1895 by a Russian scientist and astronautics pioneer, Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky. At that time, one of the strongest and most widely used construction materials in the world was steel, and so for a variety of reasons–too heavy and not strong enough—the concept remained a thought exercise.\n\nFor the longest time, the material engineering question—how to make strong enough ribbon or cable—remained elusive. But the discovery <https://fortune.com/company/discovery-insurance/> in 1991 of carbon nanotubes, with strength far surpassing steel and other materials, took the notion of a space elevator from distant to plausible.\n\n“It surprised me that somebody hadn’t dumped a ton of money into carbon nanotubes, because carbon nanotubes are an absolute game changer,” says Edwards. “They’re easily 20 to 30 times stronger than carbon fiber (Kevlar) and anything else.

Jensen loved pizza and Zoolander, and spent the little free time he had with friends or on the computer. But he\'d also just done the seemingly impossible, breaking the long-standing American men\'s 800 meter freestyle record. The 2003 article proved prescient. The following summer in Athens, Jensen won an Olympic silver medal in the demanding 1500 meter freestyle, beaten only by legendary Australian swimmer Grant Hackett.\n\n“Nobody ever goes to the Olympics trying to win a silver medal,” said Jensen. “Everyone’s trying for the gold. So, obviously, I’d have preferred to have the American National Anthem playing, but that wasn’t in the cards. And I went the distance with Grant, who in context was really my hero.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/what-links-olympic-swimmers-and-startup-founders-swimmer-vc-larsen-jensen/\n\nSource 8:\nThe young man was pacing around the edges of the Donald Trump <https://fortune.com/2024/07/18/jd-vance-trumps-vp-nominee-rust-belt-upbringing/> campaign rally, shouldering a big backpack and peering into the lens of a rangefinder toward the rooftops behind the stage where the former president would stand within the hour.\n\nHis behavior was so odd, so unlike that of the other rallygoers, that local law enforcement took notice, radioed their concerns and snapped a photo.

In the twenty-one months of the new age, the White House, Congress, and the U.S. public have had quite an education. When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled "Introduction to Outer Space," prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, "This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists." This past April a special Senate subcommittee, under Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, spent four days listening to Dr. Glennan and over forty of his top aides justify their appropriation request for the coming year. It is obvious from the record of the hearings, released early in June, that the Senators still wondered sometimes if they were not hearing science fiction rather than fact. Since the testimony, running to more than 600 pages, is the most complete account yet given of NASA\'s program, some of its highlights are worth recording here.

2024-11-07 23:14:39,654: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Unfortunately, the provided sources do not explicitly mention who was the first person to walk on the moon. However, I can provide some context about the early space age and the Apollo 11 mission, which was the first manned mission to land on the moon.

According to [1], in 1959, scientists and government officials were debating the costs and benefits of space travel and the possibility of discovering life. The article mentions that the young, the venturesome, and the insatiably curious plunged ahead, but it does not provide specific information about the Apollo 11 mission or the first person to walk on the moon.

Additionally, [1] discusses the early years of the Space Age, including the launch of Vanguard I and Atlas rockets, but it does not provide information about the moon landing.

If you're interested in learning more about the Apollo 11 mission and the first person to walk on the moon, I'd be happy to help you find the information from other sources.
