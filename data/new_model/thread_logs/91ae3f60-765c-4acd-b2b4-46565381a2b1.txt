That’s because Harris is uniquely positioned to be both a tough-on-crime, sobered prosecutor—which would appeal to conservative voters—and a progressive, champion of the left, which would appeal to young voters. \n\nHarris also checks certain boxes that previous presidents have, given her experience in both the judicial and executive branch, and on the local, state and national levels.

"It was so heady to be around power," she says. "It was my first access to people who had control of their lives." After college, Thurmond got her a job as a researcher for the Republican National Committee. It was 1976, post-Watergate, and an awful year for the GOP. (Carter beat Ford.) Moore realized that politics wasn\'t her game. "It dawned on me that this is all borrowed power. The guy who\'s powerful one day is nobody the next. I found nothing gratifying about it." She opted for business school, at George Washington University in D.C., though she hadn\'t a clue what she wanted to do with her life. Soon after graduating in 1981, Moore entered the training program at Chemical Bank in New York City with 31 other MBAs. She went into a hardball area of banking where few others wanted to go: the bankruptcy business. "A mentor had advised me, \'Find a niche and become the very best at it,\' " she explains. "I saw the bankruptcy area as a career opportunity because it had no cachet, no protocols, and no women."

Her mother pushed her too, but in other areas like music (piano) and academics. If Darla Dee brought home straight A\'s--and she did--Lorraine Moore figured she could be a nurse or a teacher, both good professions that allow a woman to follow her husband wherever he moves. "She kept telling me, \'I\'ll never do that. I\'ll do anything but that!\' "her mother recalls. "We argued a lot, and I always lost." Darla\'s sister, Lisa, was better at fulfilling mom\'s expectations: Lisa is a nurse, with a husband and two sons, in Boston. In high school (all white, since Lake City was one of the last American towns to be integrated), Darla wasn\'t hugely popular. "I was on the fringe. I rejected what you do to be popular--the beauty queen/cheerleader/sorority thing," she says. "I must have had an air of superiority about me, but I felt destined for bigger things." Her first big thing was a summer internship with Senator Strom Thurmond during college at the University of South Carolina.

She was an intern at the White House in 2012 during former President Barack Obama’s second term. That internship took place as McBride got her bachelor’s degree from American University where she was studying government and American politics. McBride made headlines in 2020 when she won her seat in the state senate, and became the first openly transgender politician elected to that role as well. She has been serving in that position since, focusing on education, families, and Medicaid throughout her time in the state.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/11/06/democrat-sarah-mcbride-wins-seat-in-congress/\n\nSource 3:\n“She’s a woman of color with interesting heritage, with her dad coming from Jamaica and her mother coming from India, and her pulling herself up by her own bootstraps. That’s the American Dream story,” she said. \n\nPlus, with Harris—a former prosecutor who focused on sexual assault and fraud cases going against Trump’s “misogyny,” Perry said, “you’ve got the perfect person to run against him.”\n\nShe believes Harris can capture two niche coalitions of voters: the conservative never-Trumpers who didn’t want to vote for an elderly man, and the young leftists who want a progressive candidate. That’s because Harris is uniquely positioned to be both a tough-on-crime, sobered prosecutor—which would appeal to conservative voters—and a progressive, champion of the left, which would appeal to young voters. \n\nHarris also checks certain boxes that previous presidents have, given her experience in both the judicial and executive branch, and on the local, state and national levels. Harris previously served as the district attorney of San Francisco before becoming the attorney general of California; she won a senate seat in 2017 in a convincing fashion, capturing over 60% of the vote.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/23/kamala-harris-perfect-candidate-to-beat-trump-presidential-historian-barbara-perry/\n\nSource 3:\n“I always like to see a candidate have local, state, and federal experience because we’re coming back to the time when we were taking them out of [the] Senate, up until the Reagan years, when we tended to take governors,” Perry said. “She\'s got way more experience than many presidents coming into office, and certainly way more than Donald Trump ever had.” \n\nHow Harris distinguishes herself from Hillary Clinton\n\nHarris could win if she touches on the kind of “Iron Lady” character of other female leaders, such as Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s former Prime Minister, or Golda Meir, the former Prime Minister of Israel who led the country through war in the early 1970s. \n\nThose women—who were brought to serve in leadership positions in times of conflict, a la the glass cliff <https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-and-the-glass-cliff-that-lies-ahead-of-her/>—maintained their status by exuding self confidence and strength. Harris, meanwhile, can cultivate a sense of stability through authenticity—something Clinton tried, but always failed to achieve, Perry argued.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/23/kamala-harris-perfect-candidate-to-beat-trump-presidential-historian-barbara-perry/\n\nSource 4:\nStacey Abrams has had a long and storied political career—and it’s not over yet. \n\nHaving previously served as minority leader of Georgia’s House of Representatives, she’s best known for her work in voting-rights activism in a state that has battled voter suppression <https://fortune.com/2020/11/06/stacey-abrams-georgia-flips-blue-biden-harris-organizers-progressives/> for years, and for helping to turn Georgia blue in 2020 <https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/08/stacey-abrams-believers-georgia-blue-434985>. She lost two gubernatorial runs <https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/us/politics/stacey-abrams-georgia-governor-election.html> against Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and currently holds no office. But she’s not letting that slow her down. \n\n“I know what my end goal is with my work, but it’s a freeway,” Abrams explained onstage Wednesday, opposite Fortune’s Diane Brady at the Impact Initiative Conference. “It’s my job to pick the lane that gets me where I need to be—and to be able to shift lanes depending on obstacles and needs.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/stacey-abrams-georgia-voting-public-office-career-work-freeway/\n\nSource 5:\nShe spoke about growing up with her scientist-civil rights activist-immigrant mom, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, sharing lessons like her mother\'s admonishment not to complain about injustice, but to do something about it. She recounted her career as a prosecutor, citing the sexual abuse of a childhood friend as the moment that inspired her to pursue that path with her law degree. She listed her victories as California\'s attorney general, taking on banks and cartels. "Kamala Harris for the people" was how she described both the cases she filed then and her campaign today.\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during the Democratic National Convention (DNC) at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, US, on Thursday, Aug. 22, 2024.

If Clinton purposefully avoided <https://www.npr.org/2008/01/25/18418848/clinton-focus-on-best-candidate-not-race-gender> being seen as a "female candidate" in the 2008 Democratic primary and ran on it in 2016, Harris seems to fall somewhere in the middle. \n\nSome things haven\'t changed since 2016, including the GOP opponent (see recent reports <https://www.axios.com/2024/08/10/trump-calls-harris-bitch-report> that Trump has called Harris a "bitch" in private). Compared to Clinton, Harris has an eight-year head start on better understanding the political appeal of Trump and effective ways to respond to him.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/13/kamala-harris-first-female-president-why-isnt-she-talking-about-it-more/\n\nSource 7:\nEmma Hinchliffe\nemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com\n\nThe Broadsheet is Fortune\'s newsletter for and about the world\'s most powerful women.

She listed her victories as California\'s attorney general, taking on banks and cartels.

"It was so heady to be around power," she says. "It was my first access to people who had control of their lives." After college, Thurmond got her a job as a researcher for the Republican National Committee. It was 1976, post-Watergate, and an awful year for the GOP. (Carter beat Ford.) Moore realized that politics wasn\'t her game. "It dawned on me that this is all borrowed power. The guy who\'s powerful one day is nobody the next. I found nothing gratifying about it." She opted for business school, at George Washington University in D.C., though she hadn\'t a clue what she wanted to do with her life. Soon after graduating in 1981, Moore entered the training program at Chemical Bank in New York City with 31 other MBAs. She went into a hardball area of banking where few others wanted to go: the bankruptcy business. "A mentor had advised me, \'Find a niche and become the very best at it,\' " she explains. "I saw the bankruptcy area as a career opportunity because it had no cachet, no protocols, and no women."

Her mother pushed her too, but in other areas like music (piano) and academics. If Darla Dee brought home straight A\'s--and she did--Lorraine Moore figured she could be a nurse or a teacher, both good professions that allow a woman to follow her husband wherever he moves. "She kept telling me, \'I\'ll never do that. I\'ll do anything but that!\' "her mother recalls. "We argued a lot, and I always lost." Darla\'s sister, Lisa, was better at fulfilling mom\'s expectations: Lisa is a nurse, with a husband and two sons, in Boston. In high school (all white, since Lake City was one of the last American towns to be integrated), Darla wasn\'t hugely popular. "I was on the fringe. I rejected what you do to be popular--the beauty queen/cheerleader/sorority thing," she says. "I must have had an air of superiority about me, but I felt destined for bigger things." Her first big thing was a summer internship with Senator Strom Thurmond during college at the University of South Carolina.

She was an intern at the White House in 2012 during former President Barack Obama’s second term. That internship took place as McBride got her bachelor’s degree from American University where she was studying government and American politics. McBride made headlines in 2020 when she won her seat in the state senate, and became the first openly transgender politician elected to that role as well. She has been serving in that position since, focusing on education, families, and Medicaid throughout her time in the state.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/11/06/democrat-sarah-mcbride-wins-seat-in-congress/\n\nSource 3:\n“She’s a woman of color with interesting heritage, with her dad coming from Jamaica and her mother coming from India, and her pulling herself up by her own bootstraps. That’s the American Dream story,” she said. \n\nPlus, with Harris—a former prosecutor who focused on sexual assault and fraud cases going against Trump’s “misogyny,” Perry said, “you’ve got the perfect person to run against him.”\n\nShe believes Harris can capture two niche coalitions of voters: the conservative never-Trumpers who didn’t want to vote for an elderly man, and the young leftists who want a progressive candidate. That’s because Harris is uniquely positioned to be both a tough-on-crime, sobered prosecutor—which would appeal to conservative voters—and a progressive, champion of the left, which would appeal to young voters. \n\nHarris also checks certain boxes that previous presidents have, given her experience in both the judicial and executive branch, and on the local, state and national levels. Harris previously served as the district attorney of San Francisco before becoming the attorney general of California; she won a senate seat in 2017 in a convincing fashion, capturing over 60% of the vote.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/23/kamala-harris-perfect-candidate-to-beat-trump-presidential-historian-barbara-perry/\n\nSource 3:\n“I always like to see a candidate have local, state, and federal experience because we’re coming back to the time when we were taking them out of [the] Senate, up until the Reagan years, when we tended to take governors,” Perry said. “She\'s got way more experience than many presidents coming into office, and certainly way more than Donald Trump ever had.” \n\nHow Harris distinguishes herself from Hillary Clinton\n\nHarris could win if she touches on the kind of “Iron Lady” character of other female leaders, such as Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s former Prime Minister, or Golda Meir, the former Prime Minister of Israel who led the country through war in the early 1970s. \n\nThose women—who were brought to serve in leadership positions in times of conflict, a la the glass cliff <https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-and-the-glass-cliff-that-lies-ahead-of-her/>—maintained their status by exuding self confidence and strength.
