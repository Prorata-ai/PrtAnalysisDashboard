Hale himself remembers the sudden availability of his sleep data as an instant life boost. “I had kids and then had a very demanding career. I would drink coffee <https://fortune.com/well/article/best-time-to-drink-coffee/> in the morning and then drink wine at the end of the day—that was how I managed,” he says. Wearing the Oura made him realize that skimping on sleep affected everything, including how he showed up at the gym, at work, and in his personal life. “That change for me was transformative.
