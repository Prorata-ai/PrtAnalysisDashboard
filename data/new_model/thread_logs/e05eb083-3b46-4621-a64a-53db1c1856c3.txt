Embracing concepts like Extended Producer Responsibility and mass balance accounting will spur the plastics value chain to assume additional financial and operational obligations from raw materials to end-of-life, while incentivizing greater use of recycled plastics.\n\nOur challenge is to preserve the enormous benefits of plastics while eliminating plastic waste. Through the many conversations I’ve had with colleagues throughout the industry, I’m excited by the high level of alignment on the objective to end plastic pollution and transition to a circular plastics economy.\n\nFor the agreement to be effective, it will need to bring aboard as many signatories as possible and provide countries with the tools to succeed.
