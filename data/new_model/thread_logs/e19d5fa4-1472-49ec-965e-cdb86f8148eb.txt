When you sleep, your body performs work that supports healthy brain function and physical health. And for children and teens, getting enough sleep aids healthy growth and development.\n\nAdequate sleep supports the following body functions, the CDC says:\n\n * Heart and circulatory system: People who don’t sleep enough or wake up often may have a higher risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and/or stroke.\n\n * Metabolism: Not getting enough quality shut eye may lead to insulin resistance, increased eating (especially of unhealthy foods), and decreased physical activity, all of which contribute to obesity, which carries its own health risks.\n\n * Immune systems: A particular type of immune cell works harder when you sleep. That’s why those who don’t get enough sleep may get sick more often.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/should-you-go-back-to-sleep-if-you-wake-up-before-your-alarm/\n\nSource 2:\n* Cognition: Sleep aids in learning and forming long-term memories. Those who don’t get enough high-quality sleep might have problems focusing and thinking clearly. \nCopious medical studies support the need for adequate sleep, and quality sleep. Cases in point:\n\n * People who get less than five hours of sleep each night are more than three times more likely to have a stroke than those who get the recommended seven hours, according to a study published in April in the journal Neurology <https://fortune.com/well/2023/04/05/bad-sleep-increased-stroke-risk-tips-better-sleep-apnea-snoring-snorting/>.\n\n * People who struggle to fall asleep and stay asleep may also be at a greater risk of a stroke, according to research published in June in the journal Neurology <https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/07/insomnia-symptoms-trouble-sleeping-increased-stroke-risk/>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/should-you-go-back-to-sleep-if-you-wake-up-before-your-alarm/\n\nSource 3:\nSleep 101\n\nDoctors and scientists have long been touting the benefits of sleep for the brain and body. It’s true—sleep is an essential part of maintaining overall well-being. When you are well rested, your mood improves, your stress levels decrease, and you tend to feel more productive. \n\nBeyond <https://fortune.com/company/overstock-com/> quantity of sleep, research has shown that the quality <https://fortune.com/well/2023/03/03/sleep-diet-exercise-goals/> of your sleep matters too. While current guidelines recommend adults get between seven and nine hours <https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html> of sleep, over a third of Americans do not meet the minimum. It’s too easy to give in to the over-stimulating activities at your fingertips—hello, TikTok—instead of turning the lights off. Minutes scrolling on social media before bed turn into hours, and screens have made it harder to shut off the brain and prepare for a good night’s rest—ever heard of revenge bedtime procrastination <https://fortune.com/well/2022/08/25/how-to-stop-revenge-bedtime-procrastination/>?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/28/guide-to-better-sleep/\n\nSource 3:\nGetting little sleep is associated with an increased risk of chronic health conditions like heart disease and stroke. Sleeping less puts people at risk of mental health problems like anxiety and depression. One study found older adults who get five or fewer hours <https://fortune.com/well/2022/10/19/sleeping-five-hours-or-less-can-raise-your-risk-for-multiple-conditions-including-cancer-and-diabetes/> of sleep are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions. So, improving sleep can, in turn, improve our lives. Even following certain sleep habits <https://fortune.com/well/2023/02/23/healthy-sleep-habits-for-aging/> can increase your life expectancy, per one study. \n\nSleep basics\n\nHow much sleep do I need? \n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adults need at least seven hours of sleep. For those 65 and older, the CDC recommends between seven and eight hours of sleep each night. \n\nWhy is it harder to sleep for older adults?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/28/guide-to-better-sleep/\n\nSource 4:\n“Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built.

When you sleep, your body performs work that supports healthy brain function and physical health. And for children and teens, getting enough sleep aids healthy growth and development.\n\nAdequate sleep supports the following body functions, the CDC says:\n\n * Heart and circulatory system: People who don’t sleep enough or wake up often may have a higher risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and/or stroke.\n\n * Metabolism: Not getting enough quality shut eye may lead to insulin resistance, increased eating (especially of unhealthy foods), and decreased physical activity, all of which contribute to obesity, which carries its own health risks.\n\n * Immune systems: A particular type of immune cell works harder when you sleep.

It’s true—sleep is an essential part of maintaining overall well-being. When you are well rested, your mood improves, your stress levels decrease, and you tend to feel more productive. \n\nBeyond <https://fortune.com/company/overstock-com/> quantity of sleep, research has shown that the quality <https://fortune.com/well/2023/03/03/sleep-diet-exercise-goals/> of your sleep matters too. While current guidelines recommend adults get between seven and nine hours <https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html> of sleep, over a third of Americans do not meet the minimum. It’s too easy to give in to the over-stimulating activities at your fingertips—hello, TikTok—instead of turning the lights off. Minutes scrolling on social media before bed turn into hours, and screens have made it harder to shut off the brain and prepare for a good night’s rest—ever heard of revenge bedtime procrastination <https://fortune.com/well/2022/08/25/how-to-stop-revenge-bedtime-procrastination/>?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/28/guide-to-better-sleep/\n\nSource 3:\nGetting little sleep is associated with an increased risk of chronic health conditions like heart disease and stroke.

So, improving sleep can, in turn, improve our lives. Even following certain sleep habits <https://fortune.com/well/2023/02/23/healthy-sleep-habits-for-aging/> can increase your life expectancy, per one study. \n\nSleep basics\n\nHow much sleep do I need? \n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adults need at least seven hours of sleep.

2024-11-07 23:10:32,181: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health because it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support healthy brain function and physical health [2]. For instance, sleep helps to regulate the heart and circulatory system, metabolism, and immune system, which can reduce the risk of chronic health conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [1]. Additionally, sleep aids in learning and forming long-term memories, and those who don't get enough high-quality sleep might have problems focusing and thinking clearly [2].

Furthermore, sleep is crucial for cognitive function, emotional regulation, and mental health. When we don't get enough sleep, we may experience increased stress levels, anxiety, and depression [9]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep can improve our mood, reduce stress, and enhance our ability to handle daily stressors and regulate emotions [9].

2024-11-07 23:10:32,351: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health because it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support healthy brain function and physical health [2]. For instance, sleep helps to regulate the heart and circulatory system, metabolism, and immune system, which can reduce the risk of chronic health conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [1]. Additionally, sleep aids in learning and forming long-term memories, and those who don't get enough high-quality sleep might have problems focusing and thinking clearly [2].

Furthermore, sleep is crucial for cognitive function, emotional regulation, and mental health. When we don't get enough sleep, we may experience increased stress levels, anxiety, and depression [9]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep can improve our mood, reduce stress, and enhance our ability to handle daily stressors and regulate emotions [9]. Moreover, sleep is important for physical health, as it helps to repair and regenerate tissues, build bone and muscle, and strengthen our

During sleep, the body performs various functions that support healthy brain function and physical health [2]. For instance, sleep helps to regulate the heart and circulatory system, metabolism, and immune system, which can reduce the risk of chronic health conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [1]. Additionally, sleep aids in learning and forming long-term memories, and those who don't get enough high-quality sleep might have problems focusing and thinking clearly [2].

Furthermore, sleep is crucial for cognitive function, emotional regulation, and mental health. When we don't get enough sleep, we may experience increased stress levels, anxiety, and depression [9]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep can improve our mood, reduce stress, and enhance our ability to handle daily stressors and regulate emotions [9]. Moreover, sleep is important for physical health, as it helps to repair and regenerate tissues, build bone and muscle, and strengthen our immune system [3].

2024-11-07 23:10:32,686: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health because it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support healthy brain function and physical health [2]. For instance, sleep helps to regulate the heart and circulatory system, metabolism, and immune system, which can reduce the risk of chronic health conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [1]. Additionally, sleep aids in learning and forming long-term memories, and those who don't get enough high-quality sleep might have problems focusing and thinking clearly [2].

Furthermore, sleep is crucial for cognitive function, emotional regulation, and mental health. When we don't get enough sleep, we may experience increased stress levels, anxiety, and depression [9]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep can improve our mood, reduce stress, and enhance our ability to handle daily stressors and regulate emotions [9]. Moreover, sleep is important for physical health, as it helps to repair and regenerate tissues, build bone and muscle, and strengthen our immune system [3].

In summary, sleep is vital for overall health because it supports physical and mental well-being, cognitive function, and emotional regulation. It's essential to prioritize sleep and make it a crucial part of our daily routine, aiming for 7-9 hours of sleep

During sleep, the body performs various functions that support healthy brain function and physical health [2]. For instance, sleep helps to regulate the heart and circulatory system, metabolism, and immune system, which can reduce the risk of chronic health conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [1]. Additionally, sleep aids in learning and forming long-term memories, and those who don't get enough high-quality sleep might have problems focusing and thinking clearly [2].

Furthermore, sleep is crucial for cognitive function, emotional regulation, and mental health. When we don't get enough sleep, we may experience increased stress levels, anxiety, and depression [9]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep can improve our mood, reduce stress, and enhance our ability to handle daily stressors and regulate emotions [9]. Moreover, sleep is important for physical health, as it helps to repair and regenerate tissues, build bone and muscle, and strengthen our immune system [3].

In summary, sleep is vital for overall health because it supports physical and mental well-being, cognitive function, and emotional regulation. It's essential to prioritize sleep and make it a crucial part of our daily routine, aiming for 7-9 hours of sleep each night [6]. By doing so, we can reduce the risk of chronic health conditions, improve our mental health, and

For instance, sleep helps to regulate the heart and circulatory system, metabolism, and immune system, which can reduce the risk of chronic health conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [1]. Additionally, sleep aids in learning and forming long-term memories, and those who don't get enough high-quality sleep might have problems focusing and thinking clearly [2].

Furthermore, sleep is crucial for cognitive function, emotional regulation, and mental health. When we don't get enough sleep, we may experience increased stress levels, anxiety, and depression [9]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep can improve our mood, reduce stress, and enhance our ability to handle daily stressors and regulate emotions [9]. Moreover, sleep is important for physical health, as it helps to repair and regenerate tissues, build bone and muscle, and strengthen our immune system [3].

In summary, sleep is vital for overall health because it supports physical and mental well-being, cognitive function, and emotional regulation. It's essential to prioritize sleep and make it a crucial part of our daily routine, aiming for 7-9 hours of sleep each night [6]. By doing so, we can reduce the risk of chronic health conditions, improve our mental health, and enhance our overall quality of life.
