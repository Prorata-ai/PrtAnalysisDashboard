Its market share in personal computers was plummeting back then, and the cash drain was so severe that bankruptcy was a possibility.

Macintoshes make up 9% of the PC market in the U.S. today, but that share is increasingly beside the point. With 275 retail stores in nine countries, a 73% share of the U.S. MP3 player market, and the undisputed leadership position in innovation when it comes to mobile phones, Apple and its CEO are no one\'s idea of underdogs anymore.

By the following year Steve\'s regime had kicked into gear. Jobs completed the hiring of a new management team, which included several executives from his previous company, Next. Those top players would form the nucleus of the Jobs brain trust for nearly 10 years. Then came the first Macintosh after Jobs\' return, the iMac, a breakthrough all-in-one computer and monitor that heralded Apple\'s return to health. The success of the pricey iMac, coupled with drastic cost cutting, allowed Jobs to build a cash cushion.

In 1997, Jobs\' friend Ellison, later an Apple board member, lined up financing to take over the company on the assumption that Jobs would run it.

Still, he faced resistance even while developing innovative computer programs “at a time when there were no books on the subject,” he said. \n\nHe made a decision: “I knew computers by heart. I decided I wanted a computer of my own that I could decide what to do with it.”\n\nThe goal for that computer, he said, was to “help other human beings do more with their lives than they could do without a computer, and not to rely on million-dollar mainframes that companies and universities could afford.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/11/steve-wozniak-boulder-university-commencement-speech-war-protests-students-advice/\n\nSource 2:\nThat dream was soon realized. In 1976, Wozniak built out the first versions <https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak> of Apple’s personal computers, and the following year, the company released the Apple II, one of the earliest personal computers available to the general public, which was met with huge commercial success <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/1977-apple-ii-breakthrough-personal-computers-robert-lavigne/>. In 1985, Wozniak left his role at Apple to find an engineering role that didn’t also involve running a fast-growing business, selling much of his Apple stock upon his departure, according to Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak>.\n\nSince then, Wozniak has leaned into the country’s education system, spending eight years teaching fifth grade. He presented the graduating class with some advice he has collected from all of that experience: “You grow up in education to be leaders, not followers. Think for yourself and decide what’s right and wrong.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/11/steve-wozniak-boulder-university-commencement-speech-war-protests-students-advice/\n\nSource 3:\nThe "decade" of Steve actually began in 1997, when he returned to Apple after having been ousted a dozen years earlier. That was a year of triage, of a humbling investment from Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/>, of paring Apple\'s product line to a bare minimum of four computers. By the following year Steve\'s regime had kicked into gear. Jobs completed the hiring of a new management team, which included several executives from his previous company, Next. Those top players would form the nucleus of the Jobs brain trust for nearly 10 years. Then came the first Macintosh after Jobs\' return, the iMac, a breakthrough all-in-one computer and monitor that heralded Apple\'s return to health. The success of the pricey iMac, coupled with drastic cost cutting, allowed Jobs to build a cash cushion. By repairing Apple\'s balance sheet, he prepared the company for big investments to come, a shrewd business move if ever there was one. Jobs laid the foundation for Apple\'s leap from stable to stratospheric when things looked darkest. In 2000, Apple missed its financial targets in a September earnings announcement, sending its stock price plummeting in subsequent months to the equivalent of $7 in today\'s\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/decade-steve-jobs-apple/\n\nSource 3:\nannouncement, sending its stock price plummeting in subsequent months to the equivalent of $7 in today\'s prices. Yet Jobs by this time had set in motion the key elements of Apple\'s rejuvenation. Over the course of 2001, as global markets fell and the world headed into recession, Apple launched the iTunes music software (in January), the Mac OS X <https://fortune.com/company/twitter/> operating system (March), the first Apple retail stores (May), and the first iPod (November), a 5GB model that Apple bragged would hold 1,000 songs.\n<https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/decade-of-steve-3-e1475163808321.jpg>Click image to enlarge.photos, from lefT: Justin Sullivan—Getty Images; David Paul Morris—Getty Images; Gary Reyes—MCT/Landovphotos, from lefT: Justin Sullivan—Getty Images; David Paul Morris—Getty Images; Gary Reyes—MCT/Landov\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/decade-steve-jobs-apple/\n\nSource 3:\n<https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/decade-of-steve-1-e1475163704217.jpg>Click image to enlarge.Photos, from left: Jerzy Darbowski—DPA/Landov (Apple logo); Rudy Sulgan—Corbis (MOMA); Courtesy of Apple—Via Getty Images (first iPod); Lou Dematteis—Reuters/Landov (G4)Photos, from left: Jerzy Darbowski—DPA/Landov (Apple logo); Rudy Sulgan—Corbis (MOMA); Courtesy of Apple—Via Getty Images (first iPod); Lou Dematteis—Reuters/Landov (G4)\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/decade-steve-jobs-apple/\n\nSource 3:\nThe financial results have been nothing short of astounding—for Apple and for Jobs. The company was worth about $5 billion in 2000, just before Jobs unleashed Apple\'s groundbreaking "digital lifestyle" strategy, understood at the time by few critics. Today, at about $170 billion, Apple is slightly more valuable than Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/>. Its market share in personal computers was plummeting back then, and the cash drain was so severe that bankruptcy was a possibility. Now Apple has $34 billion in cash and marketable securities, surpassing the total market cap of rival Dell <https://fortune.com/company/dell-technologies/>. Macintoshes make up 9% of the PC market in the U.S. today, but that share is increasingly beside the point. With 275 retail stores in nine countries, a 73% share of the U.S. MP3 player market, and the undisputed leadership position in innovation when it comes to mobile phones, Apple and its CEO are no one\'s idea of underdogs anymore. In 2006 Disney <https://fortune.com/company/disney/> paid $7.5 billion to acquire Pixar, the computer animation film studio Jobs had nurtured and controlled. Jobs, in turn, became\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/decade-steve-jobs-apple/\n\nSource 3:\nThe market didn\'t catch on quickly to the significance of those events. iTunes was just music-playing software embedded into Macs and lacked an online store that sold music. The new operating system, though impressive, powered a niche product. The iPod was a snazzy MP3 player in an established market. As the company\'s stock languished, takeover rumors appeared from time to time. What was never reported was that Jobs seriously contemplated taking the company private with the help of newly formed buyout group Silver Lake Partners. An Apple buyout would have been the deal of the century, but according to people familiar with the talks, Jobs ultimately shut them down. That was actually the second serious proposal to buy Apple. In 1997, Jobs\' friend Ellison, later an Apple board member, lined up financing to take over the company on the assumption that Jobs would run it. In a recent interview Ellison said Jobs didn\'t like the idea of being "second-guessed" if it looked as if he\'d returned simply to make money. "He explained to me that with the moral high ground, he thought he could make decisions more easily and more gracefully," says Ellison.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/decade-steve-jobs-apple/\n\nSource 4:\n<https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/00065836_65836.jpg> Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.Photograph by Doug Menuez He is signaling his lofty intentions in an ad campaign that Jobs calls "pretty cool." Why People Who Never Even Heard of Workstations Will Soon be Using One, reads one headline. ("We want to own the term \'workstation,\'" Jobs tells his staff.)

The two began collaborating five years ago at the Home Brew Computer Club in Palo Alto. They designed their first machine in Jobs\'s bedroom, built it in his parents\' garage, and showed it to a local computer-store owner, who promptly ordered 25.

You don\'t need an Apple computer to tell you that at least four new multimillionaires are now roaming the Silicon Valley. The four men own 40% of the company, which earned $11.7 million on sales of $117 million last year. At the public-offering price, Scott\'s shares were worth $62 million, Wozniak\'s $88 million, Markkula\'s $154 million, and Jobs\'s $165 million. Wozniak spread the wealth among his relatives. His parents and\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/folks-who-brought-you-apple/\n\nSource 1:\nIn the 45-mile stretch between San Jose and San Francisco called Silicon Valley lives a computer-age version of the American dream. It turned to reality recently when Apple Computer went public at $22 a share. Venture capitalist Arthur Rock, who invested $57,600 in the company three years ago, ended up with stock worth $14 million; Teledyne Chairman Henry Singleton\'s investment of $320,800 blossomed into $26 million. Impressive enough, but nothing like what happened to Apple\'s young founders, Steven P. Jobs, 25, and Stephen G. Wozniak, 29. Graduates of Santa Clara\'s Homestead High School, Jobs and Wozniak dropped out of college. The self-taught computer whizzes went to work for local electronics companies. The two began collaborating five years ago at the Home Brew Computer Club in Palo Alto. They designed their first machine in Jobs\'s bedroom, built it in his parents\' garage, and showed it to a local computer-store owner, who promptly ordered 25. Demand for the "personal" computer, mainly from hobbyists, soon outstripped the young men\'s ability to produce, so they began looking for help. Enter A. C. Markkula Jr.,\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/folks-who-brought-you-apple/\n\nSource 1:\nJobs\'s $165 million. Wozniak spread the wealth among his relatives. His parents and siblings own nearly $3 million in Apple stock. His wife, Alice, owns $27 million. They are separated. —Grant F. Winthrop Something out of the Depression From those days they learned to stay small and keep overhead down. Hambrecht & Quist\'s scruffy quarters look like government offices in the Depression. No Eames chairs, no Kirman carpets, no Touch-Tone telephones. The staff totals 90, with only three professionals in the syndicate department and five in corporate finance. Employees are treated more like entrepreneurs than hired hands. Institutional salesmen have to pay half their expenses, including secretaries\' salaries, telephone calls, and airplane tickets. Analysts not only write research reports but also help put together prospectuses and study venture-capital deals. They earn less than the industry average in base salary, but can cash in on hefty bonuses depending on their contribution to profits. The annual paycheck for an analyst can run as high as $300,000.

Still, he faced resistance even while developing innovative computer programs “at a time when there were no books on the subject,” he said. \n\nHe made a decision: “I knew computers by heart. I decided I wanted a computer of my own that I could decide what to do with it.”\n\nThe goal for that computer, he said, was to “help other human beings do more with their lives than they could do without a computer, and not to rely on million-dollar mainframes that companies and universities could afford.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/11/steve-wozniak-boulder-university-commencement-speech-war-protests-students-advice/\n\nSource 2:\nThat dream was soon realized. In 1976, Wozniak built out the first versions <https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak> of Apple’s personal computers, and the following year, the company released the Apple II, one of the earliest personal computers available to the general public, which was met with huge commercial success <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/1977-apple-ii-breakthrough-personal-computers-robert-lavigne/>. In 1985, Wozniak left his role at Apple to find an engineering role that didn’t also involve running a fast-growing business, selling much of his Apple stock upon his departure, according to Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak>.\n\nSince then, Wozniak has leaned into the country’s education system, spending eight years teaching fifth grade. He presented the graduating class with some advice he has collected from all of that experience: “You grow up in education to be leaders, not followers. Think for yourself and decide what’s right and wrong.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/11/steve-wozniak-boulder-university-commencement-speech-war-protests-students-advice/\n\nSource 3:\nThe "decade" of Steve actually began in 1997, when he returned to Apple after having been ousted a dozen years earlier. That was a year of triage, of a humbling investment from Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/>, of paring Apple\'s product line to a bare minimum of four computers. By the following year Steve\'s regime had kicked into gear. Jobs completed the hiring of a new management team, which included several executives from his previous company, Next. Those top players would form the nucleus of the Jobs brain trust for nearly 10 years. Then came the first Macintosh after Jobs\' return, the iMac, a breakthrough all-in-one computer and monitor that heralded Apple\'s return to health. The success of the pricey iMac, coupled with drastic cost cutting, allowed Jobs to build a cash cushion. By repairing Apple\'s balance sheet, he prepared the company for big investments to come, a shrewd business move if ever there was one. Jobs laid the foundation for Apple\'s leap from stable to stratospheric when things looked darkest. In 2000, Apple missed its financial targets in a September earnings announcement, sending its stock price plummeting in subsequent months to the equivalent of $7 in today\'s\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/decade-steve-jobs-apple/\n\nSource 3:\nannouncement, sending its stock price plummeting in subsequent months to the equivalent of $7 in today\'s prices. Yet Jobs by this time had set in motion the key elements of Apple\'s rejuvenation. Over the course of 2001, as global markets fell and the world headed into recession, Apple launched the iTunes music software (in January), the Mac OS X <https://fortune.com/company/twitter/> operating system (March), the first Apple retail stores (May), and the first iPod (November), a 5GB model that Apple bragged would hold 1,000 songs.\n<https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/decade-of-steve-3-e1475163808321.jpg>Click image to enlarge.photos, from lefT: Justin Sullivan—Getty Images; David Paul Morris—Getty Images; Gary Reyes—MCT/Landovphotos, from lefT: Justin Sullivan—Getty Images; David Paul Morris—Getty Images; Gary Reyes—MCT/Landov\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/decade-steve-jobs-apple/\n\nSource 3:\n<https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/decade-of-steve-1-e1475163704217.jpg>Click image to enlarge.Photos, from left: Jerzy Darbowski—DPA/Landov (Apple logo); Rudy Sulgan—Corbis (MOMA); Courtesy of Apple—Via Getty Images (first iPod); Lou Dematteis—Reuters/Landov (G4)Photos, from left: Jerzy Darbowski—DPA/Landov (Apple logo); Rudy Sulgan—Corbis (MOMA); Courtesy of Apple—Via Getty Images (first iPod); Lou Dematteis—Reuters/Landov (G4)\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/decade-steve-jobs-apple/\n\nSource 3:\nThe financial results have been nothing short of astounding—for Apple and for Jobs. The company was worth about $5 billion in 2000, just before Jobs unleashed Apple\'s groundbreaking "digital lifestyle" strategy, understood at the time by few critics. Today, at about $170 billion, Apple is slightly more valuable than Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/>. Its market share in personal computers was plummeting back then, and the cash drain was so severe that bankruptcy was a possibility. Now Apple has $34 billion in cash and marketable securities, surpassing the total market cap of rival Dell <https://fortune.com/company/dell-technologies/>. Macintoshes make up 9% of the PC market in the U.S. today, but that share is increasingly beside the point. With 275 retail stores in nine countries, a 73% share of the U.S. MP3 player market, and the undisputed leadership position in innovation when it comes to mobile phones, Apple and its CEO are no one\'s idea of underdogs anymore. In 2006 Disney <https://fortune.com/company/disney/> paid $7.5 billion to acquire Pixar, the computer animation film studio Jobs had nurtured and controlled. Jobs, in turn, became\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/decade-steve-jobs-apple/\n\nSource 3:\nThe market didn\'t catch on quickly to the significance of those events. iTunes was just music-playing software embedded into Macs and lacked an online store that sold music. The new operating system, though impressive, powered a niche product. The iPod was a snazzy MP3 player in an established market. As the company\'s stock languished, takeover rumors appeared from time to time. What was never reported was that Jobs seriously contemplated taking the company private with the help of newly formed buyout group Silver Lake Partners. An Apple buyout would have been the deal of the century, but according to people familiar with the talks, Jobs ultimately shut them down. That was actually the second serious proposal to buy Apple. In 1997, Jobs\' friend Ellison, later an Apple board member, lined up financing to take over the company on the assumption that Jobs would run it. In a recent interview Ellison said Jobs didn\'t like the idea of being "second-guessed" if it looked as if he\'d returned simply to make money. "He explained to me that with the moral high ground, he thought he could make decisions more easily and more gracefully," says Ellison.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/decade-steve-jobs-apple/\n\nSource 4:\n<https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/00065836_65836.jpg> Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.Photograph by Doug Menuez He is signaling his lofty intentions in an ad campaign that Jobs calls "pretty cool." Why People Who Never Even Heard of Workstations Will Soon be Using One, reads one headline. ("We want to own the term \'workstation,\'" Jobs tells his staff.) Another ad proclaims: In the 90\'s we\'ll probably see only 10 real breakthroughs in computers. Here are seven of them.
