Scammers might pick something expensive, like a smartphone, to get attention — and again ask for payment information or send a malicious link. They might also try to lure in consumers with promises of a giveaway, or by using language that creates a false sense of urgency.\n\nAmazon is attempting “to ensure scammers are not using our brand to take advantage of people who trust us,” Knapp wrote, adding that customers can confirm their purchases and verify messages from the company on its app or website.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/16/amazon-prime-day-big-shopping-event-scammers-experts-warn/\n\nSource 1:\nAmid increasing pressure to tackle counterfeit products, Amazon has reported getting rid of millions of phony products in recent years. The company said it also blocked billions of bad listings from making it on to its site. In 2023, Amazon the company said more than 7 million counterfeit items were "identified, seized and appropriately disposed of.” The online retailer has also filed multiple lawsuits against fake review brokers <https://apnews.com/article/technology-lawsuits-amazoncom-inc-03329beafb3b1eba170a13c99ee0d318>.\n\nAmazon notes customers can also report fake reviews and other scams on its website <https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GRGRY7AQ3LMPXVCV>. If a shopper purchases a counterfeit item detected by the company, Amazon has said it will “proactively contact” the customer and provide a refund.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/07/16/amazon-prime-day-big-shopping-event-scammers-experts-warn/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/16/amazon-prime-day-big-shopping-event-scammers-experts-warn/\n\nSource 1:\nConsumers might need to be more vigilant this year than ever before. In June, the Better Business Bureau published a report that said it received a record number of phishing reports in 2023. Reports are also trending up so far this year, the organization said.\n\nMeanwhile, in a report released this month, the Israel-founded cybersecurity company Check Point Software Technologies said more than 1,230 new websites that associated themselves with Amazon popped up in June. The vast majority of them were malicious or appeared suspicious, according to Check Point.\n\nScott Knapp, director of worldwide buyer risk prevention at Amazon, identifies two areas that the company has seen hoaxes around come Prime Day in recent years: Prime membership <https://apnews.com/article/amazon-prime-ftc-lawsuit-9e60955fc71d9891ed16c5b856222279> and order confirmations.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/16/amazon-prime-day-big-shopping-event-scammers-experts-warn/\n\nSource 2:\nAs that has happened, Amazon has built a massive advertising business <https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/amazon-andy-jassy-earnings-accelerated-growth-aws-ads> within its own shopping empire, generating nearly $47 billion in revenue in 2023. Google’s core business, of course, is also advertising <https://fortune.com/2024/04/26/youtube-was-hero-google-alphabet-q1-earnings-netflix-competition/>. A product search that begins on Amazon (or Walmart or Temu or Shein, for that matter) is a product search that Google can’t monetize with ads. Part of the problem if you’re Google, or the advantage if you’re Amazon, is that many Amazon customers who become reliant on the Prime shipping <https://fortune.com/2024/04/24/amazon-unlimited-grocery-delivery-prime/> program don’t price-compare or shop around except, perhaps, on expensive items.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/24/google-shopping-amazon-prime-day-deals-sean-scott/\n\nSource 2:\nMaybe more should. To be clear, Amazon has a reputation for low prices. Last year, for example, e-commerce analytics firm Profitero named Amazon the online retailer with the lowest prices for the seventh year in a row. (Note that a company like Temu wouldn’t be included in a research study like that one because it doesn’t sell brand-name goods across a wide selection of categories.)\n\nBut price-comparison research can indeed be worthwhile. I recently was in the market for an exciting purchase: an air filter for a furnace. For a variety of uninteresting reasons, I wanted to buy a single filter and not a multipack as I usually would. After wading through multipacks on Amazon’s search results page, I found a single filter for sale. It cost around $18.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/24/google-shopping-amazon-prime-day-deals-sean-scott/\n\nSource 3:\nAmazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/05/15/jeff-bezos-revealed-secret-drenched-terrified-sweat/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/15/jeff-bezos-revealed-secret-drenched-terrified-sweat/\n\nSource 4:\nOn the surface, it\'s fair to wonder how much screen space and customer browsing time Amazon is actually saving by eliminating this one line of information. With customers increasingly using smartphones to browse and buy on the web, companies have optimized the mobile versions of their sites and apps for smaller screens. \n\nRatings and reviews have long served as one of Amazon\'s biggest differentiators and advantages, but also a source of exasperation. As Amazon has courted millions of merchants across to the globe to begin selling through its marketplace, some have tried to game the reviews system through tactics ranging from paying shoppers for five-star reviews to merging a new product onto an existing product\'s listing so the new merchandise looks like it\'s carrying a high rating.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/15/amazon-testing-product-search-results-remove-customer-review-star-ratings/\n\nSource 5:\nTo be clear, the company is facing myriad challenges, including some self-induced. Its plans to reinvent brick-and-mortar shopping through technology <https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/amazon-just-walk-out-co-inventor-dilip-kumar-explains-changes-to-cashierless-tech-strategy/> haven’t gone as planned. The Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, however unlikely, could someday force the company to overhaul its business or even split it into parts. Amazon’s relationship with the hundreds of thousands of sellers who account for 60% of the company’s product sales has probably never been worse no matter what Amazon’s CEO says <https://fortune.com/2024/04/11/andy-jassy-shareholder-letter-amazon-seller-relationship/>. And as the nascent generative AI sector has boomed, Amazon has found itself in some instances trailing competitors. \n\nBut for today, considering the financial results Amazon is showing, and considering the fact that the company is finally at a size that it can, as Jassy said on the earnings call, both invest aggressively in its future while also pumping out real profits, this certainly feels like the Amazon everyone should have feared.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/amazon-andy-jassy-earnings-accelerated-growth-aws-ads/\n\nSource 5:\nThen there\'s Amazon\'s "third-party seller services" division—another highly profitable business line consisting of all the fees, however controversial <https://fortune.com/2024/03/08/ftc-amazon-seller-fees-inbound-placement-low-inventory-antitrust/>, that the company charges independent merchants to sell and ship goods sold through its shopping sites. That business grew 16% year over year in the first quarter, and the $35 billion in revenue it generated is almost as much as AWS and Amazon\'s ad business combined.\n\nOver the decade-plus that I’ve covered this company, it’s become common for stock analysts to ask Amazon officials on earnings calls whether the company is currently operating in more of an investing cycle than a profits one, or vice versa. And on last week’s earnings call, an analyst posed such a question once again. But the answer was much different than ever before.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/amazon-andy-jassy-earnings-accelerated-growth-aws-ads/\n\nSource 6:\nAmazon (no. 2 <https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/> in the Fortune 500) under CEO Andy Jassy has finally hit an inflection point <https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/amazon-andy-jassy-earnings-accelerated-growth-aws-ads/> where it can both invest heavily in long-term bets like generative AI <https://fortune.com/2024/04/30/amazon-aws-100-billion-revenue-gen-ai-earnings/> while at the same time produce significant profits, Fortune’s Jason Del Rey recently reported. In April, Amazon reported Q1 2024 earnings <https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2024/Amazon.com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results-68b9258cd/default.aspx> with revenue of $143.3 billion, up 13% year over year and $10 billion in profit. \n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) revenue in Q1 was $25 billion, an increase of 17% year over year. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue run rate business, Olsavsky said on the April earnings call.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/amazon-market-cap-2-trillion-cfo-generative-ai-cutting-costs/\n\nSource 7:\nHappy Friday. This is Fortune tech correspondent Jason Del Rey.\n\nAt Amazon\'s founding 30 years ago today, its name wasn’t even Amazon. It was Cadabra—short for abracadabra. \n\nAs in magic. \n\nFor the last three decades, when Amazon operates at its best, magic is just what it can feel like for customers. Endless aisles of merchandise available with a click of a button from just about anywhere. Magic. An item showing up at your door mere hours after pressing “Buy Now.” Magic. The ability to grab a juice off the shelf at a corner store and legally walk out without stopping to pay, or maybe you do stop to pay—but with your freaking palm. Magic.\n\nAt one time or another, you could say something similar about an experience across Amazon’s other business lines too, whether it be Kindle, Amazon Web Services, or maybe even Prime Video. Someday, that might be the feeling people also get when they use Amazon’s healthcare service or Kuiper satellite broadband offering or an invention that isn’t even in the works yet, like an Amazon commercial airline or something far afield that only the AI gods could predict.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/05/jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-amazon-30-year-anniversary/\n\nSource 8:\n“This is a growth area,” Charles Lindsey, associate professor of marketing at University at Buffalo School of Management, told Fortune. “It wouldn\'t surprise me if in three years, five years, it actually overtakes eBay.”\n\nAmazon and eBay did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nFrom online garage sale to e-commerce giant\n\nMarketplace’s astronomical growth is in large part because the platform is simply easy to use and linked to a site where so many people are preexisting members, Lindsey argued. \n\n“There\'s a trust factor because it\'s associated with Facebook,” he said. “It has an easy-to-use interface. It\'s integrated with Facebook Messenger, so it\'s easy to kind of go back and forth.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-marketplace-ecommerce-amazon-gen-z/'}

2024-11-07 23:15:44,071: ObserveEventsHandler(  179): MEASUREMENT: LLMPredictStart template_args: {'context_str': 'Source 1:\nLast year <https://apnews.com/article/amazon-prime-day-discount-sale-876229de851338c0e0cd6039cae24829>, for example, more than two-third of scams reported by Amazon customers claimed to be related to order or account issues, Knapp wrote in an emailed statement. People reported getting unsolicited calls or emails saying there was something wrong with their Prime membership and seeking bank account or other payment information to reinstate the accounts, Knapp explained.\n\nUrging consumers to confirm an order they didn\'t place is also a common tactic at this time of year, he added. Scammers might pick something expensive, like a smartphone, to get attention — and again ask for payment information or send a malicious link. They might also try to lure in consumers with promises of a giveaway, or by using language that creates a false sense of urgency.\n\nAmazon is attempting “to ensure scammers are not using our brand to take advantage of people who trust us,” Knapp wrote, adding that customers can confirm their purchases and verify messages from the company on its app or website.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/16/amazon-prime-day-big-shopping-event-scammers-experts-warn/\n\nSource 1:\nAmid increasing pressure to tackle counterfeit products, Amazon has reported getting rid of millions of phony products in recent years. The company said it also blocked billions of bad listings from making it on to its site. In 2023, Amazon the company said more than 7 million counterfeit items were "identified, seized and appropriately disposed of.” The online retailer has also filed multiple lawsuits against fake review brokers <https://apnews.com/article/technology-lawsuits-amazoncom-inc-03329beafb3b1eba170a13c99ee0d318>.\n\nAmazon notes customers can also report fake reviews and other scams on its website <https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GRGRY7AQ3LMPXVCV>. If a shopper purchases a counterfeit item detected by the company, Amazon has said it will “proactively contact” the customer and provide a refund.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/07/16/amazon-prime-day-big-shopping-event-scammers-experts-warn/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/16/amazon-prime-day-big-shopping-event-scammers-experts-warn/\n\nSource 1:\nConsumers might need to be more vigilant this year than ever before. In June, the Better Business Bureau published a report that said it received a record number of phishing reports in 2023. Reports are also trending up so far this year, the organization said.\n\nMeanwhile, in a report released this month, the Israel-founded cybersecurity company Check Point Software Technologies said more than 1,230 new websites that associated themselves with Amazon popped up in June. The vast majority of them were malicious or appeared suspicious, according to Check Point.\n\nScott Knapp, director of worldwide buyer risk prevention at Amazon, identifies two areas that the company has seen hoaxes around come Prime Day in recent years: Prime membership <https://apnews.com/article/amazon-prime-ftc-lawsuit-9e60955fc71d9891ed16c5b856222279> and order confirmations.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/16/amazon-prime-day-big-shopping-event-scammers-experts-warn/\n\nSource 2:\nAs that has happened, Amazon has built a massive advertising business <https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/amazon-andy-jassy-earnings-accelerated-growth-aws-ads> within its own shopping empire, generating nearly $47 billion in revenue in 2023. Google’s core business, of course, is also advertising <https://fortune.com/2024/04/26/youtube-was-hero-google-alphabet-q1-earnings-netflix-competition/>. A product search that begins on Amazon (or Walmart or Temu or Shein, for that matter) is a product search that Google can’t monetize with ads. Part of the problem if you’re Google, or the advantage if you’re Amazon, is that many Amazon customers who become reliant on the Prime shipping <https://fortune.com/2024/04/24/amazon-unlimited-grocery-delivery-prime/> program don’t price-compare or shop around except, perhaps, on expensive items.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/24/google-shopping-amazon-prime-day-deals-sean-scott/\n\nSource 2:\nMaybe more should. To be clear, Amazon has a reputation for low prices. Last year, for example, e-commerce analytics firm Profitero named Amazon the online retailer with the lowest prices for the seventh year in a row. (Note that a company like Temu wouldn’t be included in a research study like that one because it doesn’t sell brand-name goods across a wide selection of categories.)\n\nBut price-comparison research can indeed be worthwhile. I recently was in the market for an exciting purchase: an air filter for a furnace. For a variety of uninteresting reasons, I wanted to buy a single filter and not a multipack as I usually would. After wading through multipacks on Amazon’s search results page, I found a single filter for sale. It cost around $18.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/24/google-shopping-amazon-prime-day-deals-sean-scott/\n\nSource 3:\nAmazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/05/15/jeff-bezos-revealed-secret-drenched-terrified-sweat/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/15/jeff-bezos-revealed-secret-drenched-terrified-sweat/\n\nSource 4:\nOn the surface, it\'s fair to wonder how much screen space and customer browsing time Amazon is actually saving by eliminating this one line of information. With customers increasingly using smartphones to browse and buy on the web, companies have optimized the mobile versions of their sites and apps for smaller screens. \n\nRatings and reviews have long served as one of Amazon\'s biggest differentiators and advantages, but also a source of exasperation. As Amazon has courted millions of merchants across to the globe to begin selling through its marketplace, some have tried to game the reviews system through tactics ranging from paying shoppers for five-star reviews to merging a new product onto an existing product\'s listing so the new merchandise looks like it\'s carrying a high rating.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/15/amazon-testing-product-search-results-remove-customer-review-star-ratings/\n\nSource 5:\nTo be clear, the company is facing myriad challenges, including some self-induced. Its plans to reinvent brick-and-mortar shopping through technology <https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/amazon-just-walk-out-co-inventor-dilip-kumar-explains-changes-to-cashierless-tech-strategy/> haven’t gone as planned. The Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, however unlikely, could someday force the company to overhaul its business or even split it into parts. Amazon’s relationship with the hundreds of thousands of sellers who account for 60% of the company’s product sales has probably never been worse no matter what Amazon’s CEO says <https://fortune.com/2024/04/11/andy-jassy-shareholder-letter-amazon-seller-relationship/>. And as the nascent generative AI sector has boomed, Amazon has found itself in some instances trailing competitors. \n\nBut for today, considering the financial results Amazon is showing, and considering the fact that the company is finally at a size that it can, as Jassy said on the earnings call, both invest aggressively in its future while also pumping out real profits, this certainly feels like the Amazon everyone should have feared.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/amazon-andy-jassy-earnings-accelerated-growth-aws-ads/\n\nSource 5:\nThen there\'s Amazon\'s "third-party seller services" division—another highly profitable business line consisting of all the fees, however controversial <https://fortune.com/2024/03/08/ftc-amazon-seller-fees-inbound-placement-low-inventory-antitrust/>, that the company charges independent merchants to sell and ship goods sold through its shopping sites. That business grew 16% year over year in the first quarter, and the $35 billion in revenue it generated is almost as much as AWS and Amazon\'s ad business combined.\n\nOver the decade-plus that I’ve covered this company, it’s become common for stock analysts to ask Amazon officials on earnings calls whether the company is currently operating in more of an investing cycle than a profits one, or vice versa. And on last week’s earnings call, an analyst posed such a question once again. But the answer was much different than ever before.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/amazon-andy-jassy-earnings-accelerated-growth-aws-ads/\n\nSource 6:\nAmazon (no. 2 <https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/> in the Fortune 500) under CEO Andy Jassy has finally hit an inflection point <https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/amazon-andy-jassy-earnings-accelerated-growth-aws-ads/> where it can both invest heavily in long-term bets like generative AI <https://fortune.com/2024/04/30/amazon-aws-100-billion-revenue-gen-ai-earnings/> while at the same time produce significant profits, Fortune’s Jason Del Rey recently reported. In April, Amazon reported Q1 2024 earnings <https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2024/Amazon.com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results-68b9258cd/default.aspx> with revenue of $143.3 billion, up 13% year over year and $10 billion in profit. \n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) revenue in Q1 was $25 billion, an increase of 17% year over year. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue run rate business, Olsavsky said on the April earnings call.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/amazon-market-cap-2-trillion-cfo-generative-ai-cutting-costs/\n\nSource 7:\nHappy Friday. This is Fortune tech correspondent Jason Del Rey.\n\nAt Amazon\'s founding 30 years ago today, its name wasn’t even Amazon. It was Cadabra—short for abracadabra. \n\nAs in magic. \n\nFor the last three decades, when Amazon operates at its best, magic is just what it can feel like for customers. Endless aisles of merchandise available with a click of a button from just about anywhere. Magic. An item showing up at your door mere hours after pressing “Buy Now.” Magic. The ability to grab a juice off the shelf at a corner store and legally walk out without stopping to pay, or maybe you do stop to pay—but with your freaking palm. Magic.\n\nAt one time or another, you could say something similar about an experience across Amazon’s other business lines too, whether it be Kindle, Amazon Web Services, or maybe even Prime Video. Someday, that might be the feeling people also get when they use Amazon’s healthcare service or Kuiper satellite broadband offering or an invention that isn’t even in the works yet, like an Amazon commercial airline or something far afield that only the AI gods could predict.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/05/jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-amazon-30-year-anniversary/\n\nSource 8:\n“This is a growth area,” Charles Lindsey, associate professor of marketing at University at Buffalo School of Management, told Fortune. “It wouldn\'t surprise me if in three years, five years, it actually overtakes eBay.”\n\nAmazon and eBay did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nFrom online garage sale to e-commerce giant\n\nMarketplace’s astronomical growth is in large part because the platform is simply easy to use and linked to a site where so many people are preexisting members, Lindsey argued. \n\n“There\'s a trust factor because it\'s associated with Facebook,” he said. “It has an easy-to-use interface. It\'s integrated with Facebook Messenger, so it\'s easy to kind of go back and forth.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-marketplace-ecommerce-amazon-gen-z/'}
