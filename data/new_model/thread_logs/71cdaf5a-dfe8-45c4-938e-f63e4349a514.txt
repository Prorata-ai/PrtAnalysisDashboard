Were such a plan widely used, employers would undoubtedly come around to aiding employees with repayment commitments." Some business judgments In recent years FORTUNE has referred to the views of other advocates of massive credit for higher education. One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, "Study now, pay later," but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry. He contends that a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it. He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where "the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive." Van den Haag would have the colleges lend to, or as he sees it, invest in students after raising capital by selling bonds, or simply endorse students\' notes and rediscount them.

To thrive, the U.S. needs to churn out better-prepared high school graduates; it needs to lower health-care costs or at least allocate them more rationally; it needs to find a way to pay for the baby-boomers' retirement that doesn't bankrupt all our old-line corporations or result in huge tax hikes; and it needs to find a way to stop borrowing so much money from foreigners.

Brookings reported that forgiving all federal student loans would cost an estimated $1.6 trillion as of February 2021; a blanket one-time $10,000 to borrowers would cost about $373 billion.\n\nA transfer of wealth of these magnitudes would have a positive effect on the economy, but the “bang for the buck is quite low” compared with other, more progressive endeavors, says Looney, who’s also a professor of finance at the University of Utah. Because people with student loan debt generally earn more money, they won’t benefit as much from relief as other groups would.\n\n“The economic effects of debt forgiveness are exaggerated,” says Looney, whose study of the issue finds that even $10,000 in debt forgiveness would cost roughly as much as the country has spent on food stamps since 2000. He suggests that continued targeted student loan relief efforts, such as additional assistance to borrowers who were Pell Grant recipients, might have a broader impact; Pell Grants are issued to students who demonstrate financial need.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.6215569), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='5db5119f-7501-44e1-b8e3-e2be2c8d4d32', embedding=None, metadata={'id': '006fd3a8e9f60da54199e2d11db70737d1ab22e5665f459ccc5544871be6599c-1', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': '006fd3a8e9f60da54199e2d11db70737d1ab22e5665f459ccc5544871be6599c', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20240729, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-07', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2156763765-e1722270839271.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2024, 'date_month': 7, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/richard-attias-exclusive-western-countries-development-economy-international-ai/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 29, 'title': 'Richard Attias: ‘We don’t need to rely exclusively on Western countries to level up the less developed ones’', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/richard-attias-exclusive-western-countries-development-economy-international-ai/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Large parts of Africa, Asia, and South and Latin America continue to lag in terms of socio-economic development.

Such a change from traditional policy might endanger democratic education and deprive campuses of much fine talent-unless the change were linked to the expansion of financial aid to needy students. Even now about 200,000 of the most able high-school graduates annually renounce higher education, often for financial reasons. So, while such innovations as higher fees are debated, there is increased emphasis on getting more revenue from other sources. Presumably the ceiling on alumni giving has not been reached. At present only 20% of alumni respond to solicitation, so there is a large untapped source. Yale's annual take from alumni has risen from $509,000 in 1949 to $1,737,000, an increase of 240%; Yale is now aiming at $2 million a year. Almost every institution will intensify its alumni drives. While the economy expands, corporations will increase their giving. Last year corporations made tax-deductible philanthropic contributions of all kinds to the amount of almost $550 million, or 1.26% of their profit before taxes (as against the 5% that the income-tax law encourages them to give).

Some business judgments In recent years Fortune has referred to the views of other advocates of massive credit for higher education. One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, "Study now, pay later," but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry. He contends that a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it. He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where "the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive."

Brookings reported that forgiving all federal student loans would cost an estimated $1.6 trillion as of February 2021; a blanket one-time $10,000 to borrowers would cost about $373 billion.\n\nA transfer of wealth of these magnitudes would have a positive effect on the economy, but the “bang for the buck is quite low” compared with other, more progressive endeavors, says Looney, who’s also a professor of finance at the University of Utah. Because people with student loan debt generally earn more money, they won’t benefit as much from relief as other groups would.\n\n“The economic effects of debt forgiveness are exaggerated,” says Looney, whose study of the issue finds that even $10,000 in debt forgiveness would cost roughly as much as the country has spent on food stamps since 2000.

Such a change from traditional policy might endanger democratic education and deprive campuses of much fine talent-unless the change were linked to the expansion of financial aid to needy students.

So, while such innovations as higher fees are debated, there is increased emphasis on getting more revenue from other sources. Presumably the ceiling on alumni giving has not been reached. At present only 20% of alumni respond to solicitation, so there is a large untapped source.

While the economy expands, corporations will increase their giving.

Some business judgments In recent years FORTUNE has referred to the views of other advocates of massive credit for higher education. One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, "Study now, pay later," but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry. He contends that a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it. He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where "the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive." Van den Haag would have the colleges lend to, or as he sees it, invest in students after raising capital by selling bonds, or simply endorse students\' notes and rediscount them. He argues the colleges would then "have an incentive', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.62306243), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='21b071b3-6bde-4c3a-b8c7-d7f959de4906', embedding=None, metadata={'id': 'b802b7734996020d4495c7f897faed6e3efbf1005bff0998777cdeb43b639961-8', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': 'b802b7734996020d4495c7f897faed6e3efbf1005bff0998777cdeb43b639961', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20050502, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-07', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fortune-logo-1600x900-white.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2005, 'date_month': 5, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/article/its-his-economy-now-and-yours-fortune-2005/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 2, 'title': 'It’s his economy now — and yours', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/article/its-his-economy-now-and-yours-fortune-2005/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text="This is not a problem that necessarily calls for a massive government solution.

Because people with student loan debt generally earn more money, they won’t benefit as much from relief as other groups would.\n\n“The economic effects of debt forgiveness are exaggerated,” says Looney, whose study of the issue finds that even $10,000 in debt forgiveness would cost roughly as much as the country has spent on food stamps since 2000.

Such a change from traditional policy might endanger democratic education and deprive campuses of much fine talent-unless the change were linked to the expansion of financial aid to needy students. Even now about 200,000 of the most able high-school graduates annually renounce higher education, often for financial reasons. So, while such innovations as higher fees are debated, there is increased emphasis on getting more revenue from other sources. Presumably the ceiling on alumni giving has not been reached. At present only 20% of alumni respond to solicitation, so there is a large untapped source. Yale's annual take from alumni has risen from $509,000 in 1949 to $1,737,000, an increase of 240%; Yale is now aiming at $2 million a year. Almost every institution will intensify its alumni drives.

Because people with student loan debt generally earn more money, they won’t benefit as much from relief as other groups would.\n\n“The economic effects of debt forgiveness are exaggerated,” says Looney, whose study of the issue finds that even $10,000 in debt forgiveness would cost roughly as much as the country has spent on food stamps since 2000.

Such a change from traditional policy might endanger democratic education and deprive campuses of much fine talent-unless the change were linked to the expansion of financial aid to needy students. Even now about 200,000 of the most able high-school graduates annually renounce higher education, often for financial reasons. So, while such innovations as higher fees are debated, there is increased emphasis on getting more revenue from other sources. Presumably the ceiling on alumni giving has not been reached. At present only 20% of alumni respond to solicitation, so there is a large untapped source. Yale's annual take from alumni has risen from $509,000 in 1949 to $1,737,000, an increase of 240%; Yale is now aiming at $2 million a year. Almost every institution will intensify its alumni drives. While the economy expands, corporations will increase their giving. Last year corporations made tax-deductible philanthropic contributions of all kinds to the amount of almost $550 million, or 1.26% of their profit before taxes (as against the 5% that the income-tax law encourages them to give).

Some business judgments In recent years Fortune has referred to the views of other advocates of massive credit for higher education. One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, "Study now, pay later," but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry. He contends that a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it. He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where "the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive."

Roughly 55% of that amount is spent on goods and services outside universities – with significant benefits for local small businesses, according to policy think tank Committee for Sydney. \n\nAustralia’s universities rely on international students for more than a quarter of overall operating revenue, according to S&P Global Ratings, making them among the most dependent in the world. \n\nThe government’s plans — which include enrollment limits for individual universities and housing construction requirements — haven’t been through parliament yet. But international students are already facing tougher English language standards, visa rejections are becoming more common and some private colleges are being told to stop recruiting fake overseas students within six months or they’ll lose their licenses.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/17/u-k-government-is-targetting-international-students-to-rein-in-surging-immigration-and-its-working/\n\nSource 2:\nreturn on the philanthropically contributed capital.

Some business judgments In recent years FORTUNE has referred to the views of other advocates of massive credit for higher education. One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, "Study now, pay later," but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry. He contends that a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it. He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where "the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive." Van den Haag would have the colleges lend to, or as he sees it, invest in students after raising capital by selling bonds, or simply endorse students\' notes and rediscount them.

It is the sheer free-market vibrancy of the U.S. economy that will probably be its greatest strength in the decades to come. But in a more competitive world, there will be far less room for error in economic policymaking. To thrive, the U.S. needs to churn out better-prepared high school graduates; it needs to lower health-care costs or at least allocate them more rationally; it needs to find a way to pay for the baby-boomers\' retirement that doesn\'t bankrupt all our old-line corporations or result in huge tax hikes; and it needs to find a way to stop borrowing so much money from foreigners. Sure, it will help if the Fed does a competent job with monetary policy, but that\'s not what\'s going to determine the economic possibilities for our grandchildren.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/its-his-economy-now-and-yours-fortune-2005/\n\nSource 4:\nWhat student loan debt forgiveness means for the economy\n\nBoth in its scale and in its cost to taxpayers, widespread student loan debt forgiveness in any form would be one of the largest transfers of wealth in American history. Brookings reported that forgiving all federal student loans would cost an estimated $1.6 trillion as of February 2021; a blanket one-time $10,000 to borrowers would cost about $373 billion.\n\nA transfer of wealth of these magnitudes would have a positive effect on the economy, but the “bang for the buck is quite low” compared with other, more progressive endeavors, says Looney, who’s also a professor of finance at the University of Utah. Because people with student loan debt generally earn more money, they won’t benefit as much from relief as other groups would.\n\n“The economic effects of debt forgiveness are exaggerated,” says Looney, whose study of the issue finds that even $10,000 in debt forgiveness would cost roughly as much as the country has spent on food stamps since 2000. He suggests that continued targeted student loan relief efforts, such as additional assistance to borrowers who were Pell Grant recipients, might have a broader impact; Pell Grants are issued to students who demonstrate financial need.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/education/articles/how-does-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-impact-borrowers-and-the-economy/\n\nSource 5:\nLarge parts of Africa, Asia, and South and Latin America continue to lag in terms of socio-economic development. Education and health, two areas I am passionate about, are particular concerns. Although education levels and access to healthcare in low-income countries have increased since the 1960s, we cannot take this progress for granted. Risks are on the horizon. For example, if not managed correctly, the advent of AI could undo this positive work by restricting access to information to the richest in society, and, as COVID-19 revealed, the lack of vaccine access in the global south is worsening inequality <https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/february-2021/a-lack-of-vaccines-in-the-global-south-wors-ens-inequality/>.\n\nGiven the current global context and the limits of government support, we must harness global private capital to address these challenges, including via public-private partnerships.\n\nThis approach has many advantages. Private capital tends to be nimbler, with sponsors able to move faster without worrying about bureaucracy and politics. It also provides a unique chance to empower individuals and populations by reducing dependency. Rather than feeling like victims, recipients of investment focus on the potential for future growth.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/richard-attias-exclusive-western-countries-development-economy-international-ai/\n\nSource 6:\ninstruction costs. Such a change from traditional policy might endanger democratic education and deprive campuses of much fine talent-unless the change were linked to the expansion of financial aid to needy students. Even now about 200,000 of the most able high-school graduates annually renounce higher education, often for financial reasons. So, while such innovations as higher fees are debated, there is increased emphasis on getting more revenue from other sources. Presumably the ceiling on alumni giving has not been reached. At present only 20% of alumni respond to solicitation, so there is a large untapped source. Yale\'s annual take from alumni has risen from $509,000 in 1949 to $1,737,000, an increase of 240%; Yale is now aiming at $2 million a year. Almost every institution will intensify its alumni drives. While the economy expands, corporations will increase their giving. Last year corporations made tax-deductible philanthropic contributions of all kinds to the amount of almost $550 million, or 1.26% of their profit before taxes (as against the 5% that the income-tax law encourages them to give). Perhaps they will never give 5%, but educators hope that as more and more corporations adopt philanthropic policies for a\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 6:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 6:\nand administered professionally.

Brookings reported that forgiving all federal student loans would cost an estimated $1.6 trillion as of February 2021; a blanket one-time $10,000 to borrowers would cost about $373 billion.\n\nA transfer of wealth of these magnitudes would have a positive effect on the economy, but the “bang for the buck is quite low” compared with other, more progressive endeavors, says Looney, who’s also a professor of finance at the University of Utah. Because people with student loan debt generally earn more money, they won’t benefit as much from relief as other groups would.\n\n“The economic effects of debt forgiveness are exaggerated,” says Looney, whose study of the issue finds that even $10,000 in debt forgiveness would cost roughly as much as the country has spent on food stamps since 2000. He suggests that continued targeted student loan relief efforts, such as additional assistance to borrowers who were Pell Grant recipients, might have a broader impact; Pell Grants are issued to students who demonstrate financial need.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/education/articles/how-does-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-impact-borrowers-and-the-economy/\n\nSource 5:\nLarge parts of Africa, Asia, and South and Latin America continue to lag in terms of socio-economic development. Education and health, two areas I am passionate about, are particular concerns. Although education levels and access to healthcare in low-income countries have increased since the 1960s, we cannot take this progress for granted. Risks are on the horizon. For example, if not managed correctly, the advent of AI could undo this positive work by restricting access to information to the richest in society, and, as COVID-19 revealed, the lack of vaccine access in the global south is worsening inequality <https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/february-2021/a-lack-of-vaccines-in-the-global-south-wors-ens-inequality/>.\n\nGiven the current global context and the limits of government support, we must harness global private capital to address these challenges, including via public-private partnerships.\n\nThis approach has many advantages. Private capital tends to be nimbler, with sponsors able to move faster without worrying about bureaucracy and politics. It also provides a unique chance to empower individuals and populations by reducing dependency. Rather than feeling like victims, recipients of investment focus on the potential for future growth.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/richard-attias-exclusive-western-countries-development-economy-international-ai/\n\nSource 6:\ninstruction costs. Such a change from traditional policy might endanger democratic education and deprive campuses of much fine talent-unless the change were linked to the expansion of financial aid to needy students.

Roughly 55% of that amount is spent on goods and services outside universities – with significant benefits for local small businesses, according to policy think tank Committee for Sydney. \n\nAustralia’s universities rely on international students for more than a quarter of overall operating revenue, according to S&P Global Ratings, making them among the most dependent in the world. \n\nThe government’s plans — which include enrollment limits for individual universities and housing construction requirements — haven’t been through parliament yet.

Some business judgments In recent years FORTUNE has referred to the views of other advocates of massive credit for higher education. One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, "Study now, pay later," but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle.

He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where "the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive." Van den Haag would have the colleges lend to, or as he sees it, invest in students after raising capital by selling bonds, or simply endorse students\' notes and rediscount them.

It is the sheer free-market vibrancy of the U.S. economy that will probably be its greatest strength in the decades to come. But in a more competitive world, there will be far less room for error in economic policymaking. To thrive, the U.S. needs to churn out better-prepared high school graduates; it needs to lower health-care costs or at least allocate them more rationally; it needs to find a way to pay for the baby-boomers\' retirement that doesn\'t bankrupt all our old-line corporations or result in huge tax hikes; and it needs to find a way to stop borrowing so much money from foreigners. Sure, it will help if the Fed does a competent job with monetary policy, but that\'s not what\'s going to determine the economic possibilities for our grandchildren.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/its-his-economy-now-and-yours-fortune-2005/\n\nSource 4:\nWhat student loan debt forgiveness means for the economy\n\nBoth in its scale and in its cost to taxpayers, widespread student loan debt forgiveness in any form would be one of the largest transfers of wealth in American history. Brookings reported that forgiving all federal student loans would cost an estimated $1.6 trillion as of February 2021; a blanket one-time $10,000 to borrowers would cost about $373 billion.\n\nA transfer of wealth of these magnitudes would have a positive effect on the economy, but the “bang for the buck is quite low” compared with other, more progressive endeavors, says Looney, who’s also a professor of finance at the University of Utah. Because people with student loan debt generally earn more money, they won’t benefit as much from relief as other groups would.\n\n“The economic effects of debt forgiveness are exaggerated,” says Looney, whose study of the issue finds that even $10,000 in debt forgiveness would cost roughly as much as the country has spent on food stamps since 2000. He suggests that continued targeted student loan relief efforts, such as additional assistance to borrowers who were Pell Grant recipients, might have a broader impact; Pell Grants are issued to students who demonstrate financial need.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/education/articles/how-does-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-impact-borrowers-and-the-economy/\n\nSource 5:\nLarge parts of Africa, Asia, and South and Latin America continue to lag in terms of socio-economic development. Education and health, two areas I am passionate about, are particular concerns. Although education levels and access to healthcare in low-income countries have increased since the 1960s, we cannot take this progress for granted. Risks are on the horizon. For example, if not managed correctly, the advent of AI could undo this positive work by restricting access to information to the richest in society, and, as COVID-19 revealed, the lack of vaccine access in the global south is worsening inequality <https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/february-2021/a-lack-of-vaccines-in-the-global-south-wors-ens-inequality/>.\n\nGiven the current global context and the limits of government support, we must harness global private capital to address these challenges, including via public-private partnerships.\n\nThis approach has many advantages. Private capital tends to be nimbler, with sponsors able to move faster without worrying about bureaucracy and politics. It also provides a unique chance to empower individuals and populations by reducing dependency. Rather than feeling like victims, recipients of investment focus on the potential for future growth.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/richard-attias-exclusive-western-countries-development-economy-international-ai/\n\nSource 6:\ninstruction costs. Such a change from traditional policy might endanger democratic education and deprive campuses of much fine talent-unless the change were linked to the expansion of financial aid to needy students. Even now about 200,000 of the most able high-school graduates annually renounce higher education, often for financial reasons. So, while such innovations as higher fees are debated, there is increased emphasis on getting more revenue from other sources. Presumably the ceiling on alumni giving has not been reached. At present only 20% of alumni respond to solicitation, so there is a large untapped source. Yale\'s annual take from alumni has risen from $509,000 in 1949 to $1,737,000, an increase of 240%; Yale is now aiming at $2 million a year. Almost every institution will intensify its alumni drives. While the economy expands, corporations will increase their giving. Last year corporations made tax-deductible philanthropic contributions of all kinds to the amount of almost $550 million, or 1.26% of their profit before taxes (as against the 5% that the income-tax law encourages them to give). Perhaps they will never give 5%, but educators hope that as more and more corporations adopt philanthropic policies for a\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 6:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 6:\nand administered professionally.

2024-11-07 23:13:45,468: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the economy and society as a whole. On the one hand, it would increase educational opportunity and potentially lead to a more educated and skilled workforce, which could drive economic growth and development [5]. As Richard Attias notes, "Education and health, two areas I am passionate about, are particular concerns" in low-income countries, and making education free could help address these concerns and reduce inequality [5].

On the other hand, making education free would require significant investment and could be costly for governments and taxpayers. According to Brookings, forgiving all federal student loans in the US would cost an estimated $1.6 trillion [4]. Similarly, providing free education to all would likely require a massive transfer of wealth, which could have implications for the economy and taxpayers.

2024-11-07 23:13:45,620: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the economy and society as a whole. On the one hand, it would increase educational opportunity and potentially lead to a more educated and skilled workforce, which could drive economic growth and development [5]. As Richard Attias notes, "Education and health, two areas I am passionate about, are particular concerns" in low-income countries, and making education free could help address these concerns and reduce inequality [5].

On the other hand, making education free would require significant investment and could be costly for governments and taxpayers. According to Brookings, forgiving all federal student loans in the US would cost an estimated $1.6 trillion [4]. Similarly, providing free education to all would likely require a massive transfer of wealth, which could have implications for the economy and taxpayers. As Adam Looney notes, "The economic effects of debt forgiveness are exaggerated" and targeted relief efforts might have a broader impact [4].

Despite these challenges, making education free could have long-term benefits, such as increasing access

2024-11-07 23:13:45,996: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the economy and society as a whole. On the one hand, it would increase educational opportunity and potentially lead to a more educated and skilled workforce, which could drive economic growth and development [5]. As Richard Attias notes, "Education and health, two areas I am passionate about, are particular concerns" in low-income countries, and making education free could help address these concerns and reduce inequality [5].

On the other hand, making education free would require significant investment and could be costly for governments and taxpayers. According to Brookings, forgiving all federal student loans in the US would cost an estimated $1.6 trillion [4]. Similarly, providing free education to all would likely require a massive transfer of wealth, which could have implications for the economy and taxpayers. As Adam Looney notes, "The economic effects of debt forgiveness are exaggerated" and targeted relief efforts might have a broader impact [4].

Despite these challenges, making education free could have long-term benefits, such as increasing access to education for low-income and marginalized groups, reducing student loan debt, and promoting economic mobility.

As Ernest van den Haag suggests, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2].

On the other hand, making education free would require significant investment and could be costly for governments and taxpayers.

2024-11-07 23:13:46,252: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the economy and society as a whole. On the one hand, it would increase educational opportunity and potentially lead to a more educated and skilled workforce, which could drive economic growth and development [5]. As Richard Attias notes, "Education and health, two areas I am passionate about, are particular concerns" in low-income countries, and making education free could help address these concerns and reduce inequality [5].

On the other hand, making education free would require significant investment and could be costly for governments and taxpayers. According to Brookings, forgiving all federal student loans in the US would cost an estimated $1.6 trillion [4]. Similarly, providing free education to all would likely require a massive transfer of wealth, which could have implications for the economy and taxpayers. As Adam Looney notes, "The economic effects of debt forgiveness are exaggerated" and targeted relief efforts might have a broader impact [4].

Despite these challenges, making education free could have long-term benefits, such as increasing access to education for low-income and marginalized groups, reducing student loan debt, and promoting economic mobility. As Ernest van den Haag suggests, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Overall, while making education free would require significant investment, it could have important benefits for individuals, society, and the economy.

As Richard Attias notes, "Education and health, two areas I am passionate about, are particular concerns" in low-income countries, and making education free could help address these concerns and reduce inequality [5].

On the other hand, making education free would require significant investment and could be costly for governments and taxpayers. According to Brookings, forgiving all federal student loans in the US would cost an estimated $1.6 trillion [4]. Similarly, providing free education to all would likely require a massive transfer of wealth, which could have implications for the economy and taxpayers. As Adam Looney notes, "The economic effects of debt forgiveness are exaggerated" and targeted relief efforts might have a broader impact [4].

Despite these challenges, making education free could have long-term benefits, such as increasing access to education for low-income and marginalized groups, reducing student loan debt, and promoting economic mobility. As Ernest van den Haag suggests, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Overall, while making education free would require significant investment, it could have important benefits for individuals, society, and the economy.
