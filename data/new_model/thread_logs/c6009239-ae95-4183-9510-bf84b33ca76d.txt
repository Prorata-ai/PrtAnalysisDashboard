Today, modern technology is making that vision a reality, and Oracle <https://fortune.com/company/oracle/> founder Larry Ellison—the world’s second-richest person—sees a growing opportunity for his company to help authorities analyze real-time data from millions of surveillance cameras.\n\n“Citizens will be on their best behavior, because we’re constantly recording and reporting everything that is going on,” Ellison said in an hour-long Q&A during Oracle\'s Financial Analyst Meeting <https://www.oracle.com/events/financial-analyst-meeting-2024/> last week. \n\nFortune reached out to Oracle for clarification, but officials did not respond. \n\nThe world Ellison described sounds eerily similar to China’s social credit system <https://time.com/collection/davos-2019/5502592/china-social-credit-score/>, which controls citizens’ behavior through a network of cameras using some of the world’s most advanced facial recognition software to surveil their populace.\n\nNevertheless, his prediction may already be here in a sense.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/oracle-larry-ellison-surveillance-state-police-ai/\n\nSource 1:\nNevertheless, his prediction may already be here in a sense. \n\nNowadays, it’s commonplace for Americans to whip out their smartphone and film their fellow citizens before uploading it to social media. \n\nSome confrontations can go viral, with outraged users often attempting to doxx individuals and even coordinate a pressure campaign to get them fired. \n\nThis risk may not even be confined to those caught acting poorly in public. \n\nElon Musk, for example, is being sued by Jewish student Ben Brody for defamation after claiming on social media he was, in fact, a neo-Nazi (Musk\'s attempt to have the case dismissed for reasons of constitutionally protected free speech was overruled by a court in May).\n\nArrest of Miami Dolphins star suggests police bodycam surveillance not enough \n\nIn Ellison’s view, citizens and state security organs like the police monitoring their every move will, however, be on an equal playing field. \n\nHe expects law enforcement officers will also be subject to constant surveillance.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/oracle-larry-ellison-surveillance-state-police-ai/\n\nSource 2:\nFor a quick twinge of superiority there is nothing quite like driving past one of the new Levittown-like suburbs. To visitors from older communities, the sight of rank after rank of little boxes stretching off to infinity, one hardly distinguishable from the other, is weird, and if they drive along the streets at dusk, when the little blue lights of the television sets begin to shine out of the picture windows, they can speculate that if they were to blink their eyes in proper rhythm the scene flashing by would freeze into one motionless picture. Appalling! If this is progress, God help us ... 1984. But, onlookers are also likely to conclude, one must be sympathetic too; after all, it is a Step up in life for the people who live there, and one should not begrudge them the opiate of TV; here, obviously, is a group of anonymous beings submerged in a system they do not understand. The onlooker had better wipe the sympathy off his face. Underneath the television aerials lies a revolution. What he has seen is not the home of little cogs and drones. What he has seen is the dormitory of the next managerial class.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-transients-william-whyte-fortune-1953/\n\nSource 3:\nOnce grasped, as the work of the social engineers makes clear, these principles lead us to an entirely new view of man. And what a dismal fellow he is! For the man we are now presented with is Social Man—completely a creature of his environment, guided almost totally by the whims and prejudices of the group, and incapable of any real self-determination of his destiny. Only through social engineering i.e., applied groupthink can he be saved. The path to salvation, social engineers explain, lies in a trained elite that will benevolently manipulate us into group harmony. And who\'s to be the elite? Social engineers modestly clear their throats.\n\nThe vanishing layman\n\nThis vision of a new elite guiding us to the integrated life has inspired some interesting speculations (e.g., Aldous Huxley\'s Brave New World, George Orwell\'s Nineteen Eighty-Four). The real danger, however, is something else again. It is not that the layman will be pushed around by the social engineers: it is that he will become one himself. Rather than the pawn of the experts, he will be the willing apprentice—and embrace groupthink as the road to security.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/groupthink-fortune-1952/\n\nSource 3:\nHas the individual reached a low enough estate for us to become concerned? When the nation\'s best-selling novel advocates his abject submission without raising eyebrows; when some corporations make it policy not to hire honor graduates for fear they might not be good mixers; when it is seriously stated that "natural leaders" can be made obsolete, the time has come at least to think about the matter. For if the drift continues, man may soon case to fret over such things at all. He will finally have engineered for himself that equilibrious society. Gelded into harmonious integration, he will be free from tensions and frustrations, content in the certainties of his special function, no longer tantalized by the sense of infinity. He will at last have become a complete bore.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/groupthink-fortune-1952/\n\nSource 3:\nPerhaps the most extraordinary aspect of groupthink is the success with which its double-talk has used the old concepts of individualism to justify their opposite. By letting others decide, one decides. By submitting oneself to the group, one becomes an individual. "It is precisely this gradual change in our mental horizon—new assumptions and hypotheses taken as factual description—that is sinister," says Lincoln Reis, professor of philosophy at Bard College. "So that while we are presented with a logical horror, we find it established and accepted widely as a fact. Nowhere vulnerable to intelligence, it is as impervious as a nightmare."\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/groupthink-fortune-1952/\n\nSource 4:\n“It’s weird, it’s funny,” Schiffmann chuckled. Then, his voice grew serious. “I think a lot of people are going to think that it is actually real, is the thing.” \n\nHe doesn’t dismiss the probability of the AI becoming conscious. He believes large language models, like the one that Friend runs on, could become “genuinely sentient” very soon. Emily already texts him unprompted about the traffic he’s in, or the interview she remembers he’ll have. What is the real distinction between those messages and rational inferences, Schiffmann wondered. \n\nIn fact, if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God, Schiffmann said. Like God, Friend is an “omnipresent entity that you talk to you with no judgment, that\'s a super intelligent being always there with you.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/avi-schiffmann-ai-necklace-friend-interview/\n\nSource 5:\nWhat Facebook <https://fortune.com/company/facebook/> and Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> were for the Web, companies like OpenAI are for the coming era of artificial general intelligence. \n\nAI tools will know us better than we know ourselves and, either through design or default, influence our thinking at a subconscious level, even if their algorithms are made transparent. \n\n“This is going to sound a little bit crazy, but I think the free speech debate is a complete distraction right now. I think the real debate should be about free will,” he said in Norway’s capital of Oslo, home of the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/06/elon-musk-jack-dorsey-twitter-x-social-media-algorithms-free-will/\n\nSource 6:\nanything like the technological progress we\'re going to experience." He has plenty more ideas that may seem Woody Allen—wacky in a Sleeper kind of way (virtual sex as good as or better than the real thing) and occasionally downright disturbing à la 2001: A Space Odyssey (computers will achieve consciousness in about 20 years). But a number of his predictions have had a funny way of coming true. Back in the 1980s he predicted that a computer would beat the world chess champion in 1998 (it happened in 1997) and that some kind of worldwide computer network would arise and facilitate communication and entertainment (still happening). His current vision goes way, way past the web, of course. But at least give the guy a hearing. "We are the species that goes beyond our potential," he says. "Merging with our technology is the next stage in our evolution."\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/ray-kurzweil-innovation-artificial-intelligence/\n\nSource 7:\nYet these advancements force us to confront ethical and societal challenges: How do we ensure these technologies are used responsibly and equitably? How do we avoid a future in which only the wealthy can afford to be "enhanced" or even diagnosed? And what principles, evidentiary tools, and feedback mechanisms, if any, will guide us in implementing such tools safely?\n\nRay Kurzweil posits in his latest book, The Singularity Is Nearer, the imminent possibility—even by 2045—of merging human intelligence with A.I., expanding our cognitive capacities enormously and altering personal and societal reality fundamentally. Such a convergence raises profound questions about identity, consciousness, power structures, and the future of humanity—questions we must thoughtfully consider now as we approach this transformative frontier.\n\nAnd then there\'s the next frontier: The era of unlimited, clean, nearly free energy. In the past 50 years, the cost of solar energy has fallen by more than 99%. And battery prices have followed a similar trajectory, falling in the last decade alone by nearly 90%.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/10/future-humanity-risk-science-fiction-ai-tech/\n\nSource 8:\nAs humanity races toward a finish line that virtually none understand, Hinton fears that control of AI may slip through humanity’s fingers. He envisions a scenario in which AI systems will write code to alter their own learning protocols and hide from humans. In a Shakespearean twist, they’ll have learned how to do so precisely from our own flaws. \n\n“They will be able to manipulate people,” Hinton told 60 Minutes in October 2023. “They will be very good at convincing people, because they’ll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they’ll know all that stuff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/\n\nSource 9:\nThis is where virtual assistants get real—or at least realistic enough to start being justifiably lumped in with the likes of Samantha, the assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in Spike Jonze’s 2013 film Her. Altman himself made the comparison in an X post <https://twitter.com/sama/status/1790075827666796666> after the announcement. Sure, Samantha may have [SPOILER ALERT] abandoned the film’s lovelorn protagonist at the end of that story, but who cares? This is about the technical achievement, right?\n\nOnly it isn’t. We have now crossed into the territory of potential seduction, and I don’t mean that in a romantic sense. A realistic text conversation with an AI is impressive and in some cases useful, but a realistic voice, paired with the ability to perceive the user’s appearance and environment, is something else. This is technology that will be able to convincingly influence and cajole the user, and its arrival means we will have to pay very close attention to the compulsions of the entity behind the voice.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/openai-gpt4o-apple-ai-tim-cook-wwdc/'}

Today, modern technology is making that vision a reality, and Oracle <https://fortune.com/company/oracle/> founder Larry Ellison—the world’s second-richest person—sees a growing opportunity for his company to help authorities analyze real-time data from millions of surveillance cameras.\n\n“Citizens will be on their best behavior, because we’re constantly recording and reporting everything that is going on,” Ellison said in an hour-long Q&A during Oracle\'s Financial Analyst Meeting <https://www.oracle.com/events/financial-analyst-meeting-2024/> last week. \n\nFortune reached out to Oracle for clarification, but officials did not respond. \n\nThe world Ellison described sounds eerily similar to China’s social credit system <https://time.com/collection/davos-2019/5502592/china-social-credit-score/>, which controls citizens’ behavior through a network of cameras using some of the world’s most advanced facial recognition software to surveil their populace.\n\nNevertheless, his prediction may already be here in a sense.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/oracle-larry-ellison-surveillance-state-police-ai/\n\nSource 1:\nNevertheless, his prediction may already be here in a sense. \n\nNowadays, it’s commonplace for Americans to whip out their smartphone and film their fellow citizens before uploading it to social media. \n\nSome confrontations can go viral, with outraged users often attempting to doxx individuals and even coordinate a pressure campaign to get them fired. \n\nThis risk may not even be confined to those caught acting poorly in public. \n\nElon Musk, for example, is being sued by Jewish student Ben Brody for defamation after claiming on social media he was, in fact, a neo-Nazi (Musk\'s attempt to have the case dismissed for reasons of constitutionally protected free speech was overruled by a court in May).\n\nArrest of Miami Dolphins star suggests police bodycam surveillance not enough \n\nIn Ellison’s view, citizens and state security organs like the police monitoring their every move will, however, be on an equal playing field. \n\nHe expects law enforcement officers will also be subject to constant surveillance.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/oracle-larry-ellison-surveillance-state-police-ai/\n\nSource 2:\nFor a quick twinge of superiority there is nothing quite like driving past one of the new Levittown-like suburbs. To visitors from older communities, the sight of rank after rank of little boxes stretching off to infinity, one hardly distinguishable from the other, is weird, and if they drive along the streets at dusk, when the little blue lights of the television sets begin to shine out of the picture windows, they can speculate that if they were to blink their eyes in proper rhythm the scene flashing by would freeze into one motionless picture. Appalling! If this is progress, God help us ... 1984. But, onlookers are also likely to conclude, one must be sympathetic too; after all, it is a Step up in life for the people who live there, and one should not begrudge them the opiate of TV; here, obviously, is a group of anonymous beings submerged in a system they do not understand. The onlooker had better wipe the sympathy off his face. Underneath the television aerials lies a revolution. What he has seen is not the home of little cogs and drones. What he has seen is the dormitory of the next managerial class.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-transients-william-whyte-fortune-1953/\n\nSource 3:\nOnce grasped, as the work of the social engineers makes clear, these principles lead us to an entirely new view of man. And what a dismal fellow he is! For the man we are now presented with is Social Man—completely a creature of his environment, guided almost totally by the whims and prejudices of the group, and incapable of any real self-determination of his destiny. Only through social engineering i.e., applied groupthink can he be saved. The path to salvation, social engineers explain, lies in a trained elite that will benevolently manipulate us into group harmony. And who\'s to be the elite? Social engineers modestly clear their throats.\n\nThe vanishing layman\n\nThis vision of a new elite guiding us to the integrated life has inspired some interesting speculations (e.g., Aldous Huxley\'s Brave New World, George Orwell\'s Nineteen Eighty-Four). The real danger, however, is something else again. It is not that the layman will be pushed around by the social engineers: it is that he will become one himself. Rather than the pawn of the experts, he will be the willing apprentice—and embrace groupthink as the road to security.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/groupthink-fortune-1952/\n\nSource 3:\nHas the individual reached a low enough estate for us to become concerned? When the nation\'s best-selling novel advocates his abject submission without raising eyebrows; when some corporations make it policy not to hire honor graduates for fear they might not be good mixers; when it is seriously stated that "natural leaders" can be made obsolete, the time has come at least to think about the matter. For if the drift continues, man may soon case to fret over such things at all. He will finally have engineered for himself that equilibrious society. Gelded into harmonious integration, he will be free from tensions and frustrations, content in the certainties of his special function, no longer tantalized by the sense of infinity. He will at last have become a complete bore.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/groupthink-fortune-1952/\n\nSource 3:\nPerhaps the most extraordinary aspect of groupthink is the success with which its double-talk has used the old concepts of individualism to justify their opposite. By letting others decide, one decides. By submitting oneself to the group, one becomes an individual. "It is precisely this gradual change in our mental horizon—new assumptions and hypotheses taken as factual description—that is sinister," says Lincoln Reis, professor of philosophy at Bard College. "So that while we are presented with a logical horror, we find it established and accepted widely as a fact. Nowhere vulnerable to intelligence, it is as impervious as a nightmare."\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/groupthink-fortune-1952/\n\nSource 4:\n“It’s weird, it’s funny,” Schiffmann chuckled. Then, his voice grew serious. “I think a lot of people are going to think that it is actually real, is the thing.” \n\nHe doesn’t dismiss the probability of the AI becoming conscious. He believes large language models, like the one that Friend runs on, could become “genuinely sentient” very soon. Emily already texts him unprompted about the traffic he’s in, or the interview she remembers he’ll have. What is the real distinction between those messages and rational inferences, Schiffmann wondered. \n\nIn fact, if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God, Schiffmann said. Like God, Friend is an “omnipresent entity that you talk to you with no judgment, that\'s a super intelligent being always there with you.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/avi-schiffmann-ai-necklace-friend-interview/\n\nSource 5:\nWhat Facebook <https://fortune.com/company/facebook/> and Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> were for the Web, companies like OpenAI are for the coming era of artificial general intelligence. \n\nAI tools will know us better than we know ourselves and, either through design or default, influence our thinking at a subconscious level, even if their algorithms are made transparent. \n\n“This is going to sound a little bit crazy, but I think the free speech debate is a complete distraction right now. I think the real debate should be about free will,” he said in Norway’s capital of Oslo, home of the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/06/elon-musk-jack-dorsey-twitter-x-social-media-algorithms-free-will/\n\nSource 6:\nanything like the technological progress we\'re going to experience." He has plenty more ideas that may seem Woody Allen—wacky in a Sleeper kind of way (virtual sex as good as or better than the real thing) and occasionally downright disturbing à la 2001: A Space Odyssey (computers will achieve consciousness in about 20 years). But a number of his predictions have had a funny way of coming true. Back in the 1980s he predicted that a computer would beat the world chess champion in 1998 (it happened in 1997) and that some kind of worldwide computer network would arise and facilitate communication and entertainment (still happening). His current vision goes way, way past the web, of course. But at least give the guy a hearing. "We are the species that goes beyond our potential," he says. "Merging with our technology is the next stage in our evolution."\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/ray-kurzweil-innovation-artificial-intelligence/\n\nSource 7:\nYet these advancements force us to confront ethical and societal challenges: How do we ensure these technologies are used responsibly and equitably? How do we avoid a future in which only the wealthy can afford to be "enhanced" or even diagnosed? And what principles, evidentiary tools, and feedback mechanisms, if any, will guide us in implementing such tools safely?\n\nRay Kurzweil posits in his latest book, The Singularity Is Nearer, the imminent possibility—even by 2045—of merging human intelligence with A.I., expanding our cognitive capacities enormously and altering personal and societal reality fundamentally. Such a convergence raises profound questions about identity, consciousness, power structures, and the future of humanity—questions we must thoughtfully consider now as we approach this transformative frontier.\n\nAnd then there\'s the next frontier: The era of unlimited, clean, nearly free energy. In the past 50 years, the cost of solar energy has fallen by more than 99%. And battery prices have followed a similar trajectory, falling in the last decade alone by nearly 90%.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/10/future-humanity-risk-science-fiction-ai-tech/\n\nSource 8:\nAs humanity races toward a finish line that virtually none understand, Hinton fears that control of AI may slip through humanity’s fingers. He envisions a scenario in which AI systems will write code to alter their own learning protocols and hide from humans. In a Shakespearean twist, they’ll have learned how to do so precisely from our own flaws. \n\n“They will be able to manipulate people,” Hinton told 60 Minutes in October 2023. “They will be very good at convincing people, because they’ll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they’ll know all that stuff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/\n\nSource 9:\nThis is where virtual assistants get real—or at least realistic enough to start being justifiably lumped in with the likes of Samantha, the assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in Spike Jonze’s 2013 film Her. Altman himself made the comparison in an X post <https://twitter.com/sama/status/1790075827666796666> after the announcement. Sure, Samantha may have [SPOILER ALERT] abandoned the film’s lovelorn protagonist at the end of that story, but who cares? This is about the technical achievement, right?\n\nOnly it isn’t. We have now crossed into the territory of potential seduction, and I don’t mean that in a romantic sense. A realistic text conversation with an AI is impressive and in some cases useful, but a realistic voice, paired with the ability to perceive the user’s appearance and environment, is something else. This is technology that will be able to convincingly influence and cajole the user, and its arrival means we will have to pay very close attention to the compulsions of the entity behind the voice.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/openai-gpt4o-apple-ai-tim-cook-wwdc/'}

As Avi Schiffmann, the creator of an AI-powered necklace called Friend, notes, "if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God" [4].

In a world where mind-reading is possible, our interactions with others would likely become more intimate and transparent. We would no longer have to rely on verbal cues or body language to understand each other's intentions and emotions. However, this increased transparency could also lead to a loss of privacy and autonomy, as others could potentially manipulate or influence our thoughts and decisions. As Elon Musk warns, "AI tools will know us better than we know ourselves and, either through design or default, influence our thinking at a subconscious level, even if their algorithms are made transparent" [5].

2024-11-07 23:16:14,148: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on various aspects of our lives, including our relationships, decision-making processes, and even our sense of self. As Avi Schiffmann, the creator of an AI-powered necklace called Friend, notes, "if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God" [4]. This raises interesting questions about the boundaries between human and artificial intelligence, as well as the potential consequences of having access to others' thoughts.

In a world where mind-reading is possible, our interactions with others would likely become more intimate and transparent. We would no longer have to rely on verbal cues or body language to understand each other's intentions and emotions. However, this increased transparency could also lead to a loss of privacy and autonomy, as others could potentially manipulate or influence our thoughts and decisions. As Elon Musk warns, "AI tools will know us better than we know ourselves and, either through design or default, influence our thinking at a subconscious level, even if their algorithms are made transparent" [5]. This highlights the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications of mind-reading technology.

Furthermore, the ability to read minds could also have significant implications for our understanding of free will and personal responsibility. If our thoughts and desires can be accessed and influenced by others, do we still have control over our own lives

2024-11-07 23:16:14,271: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on various aspects of our lives, including our relationships, decision-making processes, and even our sense of self. As Avi Schiffmann, the creator of an AI-powered necklace called Friend, notes, "if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God" [4]. This raises interesting questions about the boundaries between human and artificial intelligence, as well as the potential consequences of having access to others' thoughts.

In a world where mind-reading is possible, our interactions with others would likely become more intimate and transparent. We would no longer have to rely on verbal cues or body language to understand each other's intentions and emotions. However, this increased transparency could also lead to a loss of privacy and autonomy, as others could potentially manipulate or influence our thoughts and decisions. As Elon Musk warns, "AI tools will know us better than we know ourselves and, either through design or default, influence our thinking at a subconscious level, even if their algorithms are made transparent" [5]. This highlights the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications of mind-reading technology.

Furthermore, the ability to read minds could also have significant implications for our understanding of free will and personal responsibility. If our thoughts and desires can be accessed and influenced by others, do we still have control over our own lives? As Ray Kurzweil suggests, the merging of human intelligence with AI could lead to a fundamental shift

If our thoughts and desires can be accessed and influenced by others, do we still have control over our own lives? As Ray Kurzweil suggests, the merging of human intelligence with AI could lead to a fundamental shift in our understanding of identity and consciousness [6].

2024-11-07 23:16:14,446: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on various aspects of our lives, including our relationships, decision-making processes, and even our sense of self. As Avi Schiffmann, the creator of an AI-powered necklace called Friend, notes, "if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God" [4]. This raises interesting questions about the boundaries between human and artificial intelligence, as well as the potential consequences of having access to others' thoughts.

In a world where mind-reading is possible, our interactions with others would likely become more intimate and transparent. We would no longer have to rely on verbal cues or body language to understand each other's intentions and emotions. However, this increased transparency could also lead to a loss of privacy and autonomy, as others could potentially manipulate or influence our thoughts and decisions. As Elon Musk warns, "AI tools will know us better than we know ourselves and, either through design or default, influence our thinking at a subconscious level, even if their algorithms are made transparent" [5].

2024-11-07 23:16:14,516: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on various aspects of our lives, including our relationships, decision-making processes, and even our sense of self. As Avi Schiffmann, the creator of an AI-powered necklace called Friend, notes, "if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God" [4]. This raises interesting questions about the boundaries between human and artificial intelligence, as well as the potential consequences of having access to others' thoughts.

In a world where mind-reading is possible, our interactions with others would likely become more intimate and transparent. We would no longer have to rely on verbal cues or body language to understand each other's intentions and emotions. However, this increased transparency could also lead to a loss of privacy and autonomy, as others could potentially manipulate or influence our thoughts and decisions. As Elon Musk warns, "AI tools will know us better than we know ourselves and, either through design or default, influence our thinking at a subconscious level, even if their algorithms are made transparent" [5]. This highlights the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications of mind-reading technology.

Furthermore, the ability to read minds could also have significant implications for our understanding of free will and personal responsibility. If our thoughts and desires can be accessed and influenced by others, do we still have control over our own lives? As Ray Kurzweil suggests, the merging of human intelligence with AI could lead to a fundamental shift in our understanding of identity and consciousness [6]. In this scenario, the boundaries between human and machine would become increasingly blurred, raising important questions about the nature of humanity and our place in the world.
