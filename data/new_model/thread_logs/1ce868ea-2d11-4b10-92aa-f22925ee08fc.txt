It should feel accessible and yet ownable—that is, less likely to get you sued for trademark infringement.

But Macron really meant it, according to a person familiar with his thinking, who said the president intends to convince his Chinese counterpart to leverage his influence over President Vladimir Putin to make the Olympic truce a reality.\n\nMacron’s attempts to throw the Russian president off guard more often end up rattling his own side. After gathering European leaders to the Palace of Versailles he notoriously refused to rule out the possibility of boots on the ground in Ukraine: an exercise in keeping Putin guessing that prompted the Germans publicly to rule out the idea and so undermine whatever ambiguity had been seeded.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/04/16/french-president-macron-boost-military-revolution-pushed-forward-france-russia-ukraine-iran-israel/\n\nSource 3:\n· The companies’ names evoke nations. “Nippon Steel bids to take over U.S. Steel” sounds painfully like “Japan bids to take over the U.S.” If Trump didn’t oppose that deal, his foundational battle cry—America First—would lose all credibility. Harris would similarly sound traitorous for endorsing the deal. But if Luxembourg’s ArcelorMittal <https://fortune.com/company/arcelormittal/> (which is bigger than Nippon Steel) wanted to buy America’s Cleveland-Cliffs <https://fortune.com/company/cleveland-cliffs/> (which is bigger than U.S. Steel), would anyone notice?\nIn understanding this ruckus, those three factors are what lawyers call the proximate cause. The deeper cause goes back over a century. When J.P. Morgan merged several firms to create U.S. Steel in 1901, it was a wonder, the world’s most valuable company. In the first Fortune 500, published in 1955, U.S. Steel ranked No. 3 by revenue, after General Motors <https://fortune.com/company/general-motors/> and Standard Oil of New Jersey. Now U.S. Steel is No. 227 and falling fast, having dropped 41 places in just the past year.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/21/us-steel-news-stock-price-nippon-takeover/\n\nSource 4:\n“EigenLayer reminds me of the 2008 recession: undercollateralize, overleverage.

The first time I met Anil, he taught me that we don’t entirely understand what happens inside a burning fire, even though it first appeared perhaps as far back as two million years ago. \n\nThere are also mission comparisons, Groom says. Both Stripe and Meter take inherently complex services—payments and networking respectively—and distill them into user-friendly offerings. Both are design-focused and also own the full stack. And the word utility comes up again: Groom sees both companies as aiming to become essential utilities for their customers, where the services work without the customer having to think about underlying complexities.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/21/meter-cofounders-sunil-anil-varanasi-launch-command-product/\n\nSource 6:\nThe number of twin primes less than X is roughly equal to X divided by the square of the natural logarithm of X. Lehmer and H. S. Vandiver of the University of Texas have also used a computer to test a famous theorem that mathematicians the world over are still trying either to prove or disprove. Three hundred years ago the French mathematician Fermat stated that it is impossible to satisfy the following equation by substituting whole numbers (except zero) for all the letters if n is greater than 2: an + bn = cn Lehmerand Vandiver have sought to find a single exception. If they could, the theorem would be disproved. Fortunately they have not had to test every conceivable combination of numbers; it is sufficient to try substituting all prime numbers for n. And there are further short cuts. The number n for example must not divide any of a certain set of so-called "Bernoulli numbers," otherwise it cannot satisfy the equation.
