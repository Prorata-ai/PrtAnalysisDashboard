Deadpool & Wolverine is scheduled to be released in the US in July.\n\nAnother franchise Disney acquired as part of the Fox deal was Avatar. The second film, released in 2022, was also cleared by Chinese regulators and became the third-highest-grossing movie in history, with $2.3 billion in ticket sales. \n\nOn June 14, Disney released Inside Out 2, generating a $295 million global haul in ticket sales that scored the biggest opening weekend in history for an animated film.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/17/marvel-deadpool-movie-china-release-disney-box-office-earnings/\n\nSource 4:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/17/marvel-deadpool-movie-china-release-disney-box-office-earnings/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/17/marvel-deadpool-movie-china-release-disney-box-office-earnings/\n\nSource 5:\n“Inside Out 2” continues to be a box office phenomenon, the likes of which the industry hasn’t seen since “Barbie” almost a year ago. In just three weeks of release, it\'s earned nearly $470 million in North America and $545.5 million internationally, bringing its global total to $1.01 billion. The sequel is the only 2024 release to cross the billion dollar mark and it did it in just 19 days, a record for an animated film.\n\n“The film’s stunning global success once again illustrates that audiences the world over will respond to compelling, entertaining movies, and that they want to enjoy them on the big screen,” said Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners, in a statement.\n\n“A Quiet Place: Day One,” directed by Michael Sarnoski and rated PG-13, is also fast approaching an important threshold out of the gates.

Six of the top 10 films of the weekend had been playing for three or more weeks.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/02/deadpool-wolverine-box-office-reagan-tops-expectations-labor-day-weekend/\n\nSource 4:\nThe third installment in an R-rated, f-bomb-laden trilogy is the first since Disney acquired rights to make movies based on the Marvel comic-book character, after closing the $71.3 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2019. Chinese regulators barred the first Deadpool from the country when it was released in 2016, and they allowed only a PG-13-rated version of 2018’s Deadpool 2.\n\nThe first two Deadpool movies grossed a combined $1.5 billion at the global box office. Deadpool & Wolverine is scheduled to be released in the US in July.\n\nAnother franchise Disney acquired as part of the Fox deal was Avatar. The second film, released in 2022, was also cleared by Chinese regulators and became the third-highest-grossing movie in history, with $2.3 billion in ticket sales. \n\nOn June 14, Disney released Inside Out 2, generating a $295 million global haul in ticket sales that scored the biggest opening weekend in history for an animated film.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/17/marvel-deadpool-movie-china-release-disney-box-office-earnings/\n\nSource 4:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/17/marvel-deadpool-movie-china-release-disney-box-office-earnings/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/17/marvel-deadpool-movie-china-release-disney-box-office-earnings/\n\nSource 5:\n“Inside Out 2” continues to be a box office phenomenon, the likes of which the industry hasn’t seen since “Barbie” almost a year ago. In just three weeks of release, it\'s earned nearly $470 million in North America and $545.5 million internationally, bringing its global total to $1.01 billion. The sequel is the only 2024 release to cross the billion dollar mark and it did it in just 19 days, a record for an animated film.\n\n“The film’s stunning global success once again illustrates that audiences the world over will respond to compelling, entertaining movies, and that they want to enjoy them on the big screen,” said Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners, in a statement.\n\n“A Quiet Place: Day One,” directed by Michael Sarnoski and rated PG-13, is also fast approaching an important threshold out of the gates. Including the $45.5 million from international showings in 59 markets, the $67 million production has already made $98.5 million.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/kevin-costner-movie-horizon-box-office-debut-santa-barbara-property-mortgage/\n\nSource 6:\nMeanwhile, “Deadpool & Wolverine,” which co-stars Hugh Jackman, continued its march through box-office records. The film, directed by Shawn Levy, is only the second R-rated movie to reach $1 billion, following 2019’s “Joker.” <https://apnews.com/article/us-news-ap-top-news-movies-fall-films-entertainment-f2eb430a7c5b4b4eb366c82547738cfd> In three weeks, it’s already one of the most lucrative Marvel releases and trails only Disney’s other 2024 smash, “Inside Out” ($1.6 billion worldwide) among movies released this year.\n\nLively makes a cameo in “Deadpool & Wolverine” but she both stars in and produced “It Ends With Us.” Adapted from the bestselling romance novel by Colleen Hoover, Lively stars as Lily Bloom, a Boston florist torn between two men, one from her present life (Justin Baldoni, who also directed the film) and another who was her first love (Brandon Sklenar).\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-us-box-office-films/\n\nSource 7:\n“Inside Out 2” landed in fourth place with $8.3 million.

It also passed “Top Gun: Maverick” to become the 12th highest-earning global release of all time.\n\nIt all adds up to one of the top 10 domestic grossing weekends of all time, with $277.5 million, according to Comscore. That puts it ahead of this weekend last year, when “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” helped propel the box office to over $216.9 million in their second weekends.\n\n“This is one for the history books," Dergarabedian said. ”Hopefully this will carry over into August."\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.

The edgier content actually enhances their appeal to older teens and young 20-somethings.”\n\nThe top domestic opening of all time still firmly belongs to “Avengers: Endgame” with $357.1 million. It’s followed by “Spider-Man: No Way Home” ($260.1 million), “Avengers: Infinity War” ($257.6 million), “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” ($247.9 million) and “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” ($220 million).\n\nSecond place went to Universal\'s “Twisters,” now in its second weekend <https://apnews.com/article/twisters-box-office-316b848fac02b7ea09ae60a1dadffbef> with $35.3 million. The standalone sequel to “Twister” has now earned $154.9 million in North America. Universal also claimed third place with “Despicable Me 4,” which added $14.2 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its domestic total to nearly $291 million.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/28/disney-deadpool-and-wolverine-r-rated-box-office-record-marvel/\n\nSource 8:\n“Alien: Romulus" <https://apnews.com/article/alien-romulus-cailee-spaeny-fede-alvarez-interview-b10f5ef76b6899c8f416ce8cbd2b01b2> and “It Ends With Us,” <https://apnews.com/article/it-ends-with-us-movie-review-blake-lively-035aa1becea86aa90a5f1aa982cf823c> two more holdovers from the summer, came in fourth and fifth place, respectively.
