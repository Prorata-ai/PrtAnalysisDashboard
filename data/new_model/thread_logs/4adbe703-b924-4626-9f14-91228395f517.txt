The country has risen from seventh in BCG’s list to first in 10 years.\n\nThe findings come at a time when the U.K. and Australia are overhauling <https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-67609963> their immigration system to tighten the criteria for those looking to enter the country. Britain has seen its fair share of struggles attracting inter-Europe talent following Brexit. \n\nHowever, labor shortages pose a real threat, which immigration helps address.

If we add up the liquid value of venture-backed M&A and IPO outcomes over the past decade, Australia comes in third (behind the U.S. and China) in total liquidity. Based on our findings from Dealroom.co and IMF World Economic Outlook data in 2024, this has occurred despite Australia remaining an underserved market, with venture capital investment accounting for only 0.18% of GDP in Australia, compared to 0.27% in China, 0.55% in the U.S., 0.64% in the U.K., and 0.77% in Israel.\n\nHow has this happened?\n\nLimited capital, population size, and the tyranny of distance were once seen as barriers for Australian startups with global ambitions. Those dynamics have now converged into the region’s competitive advantage, as knowing how to do more with less is a breeding ground for capital-efficient companies.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/11/australia-startup-scene-liquidity-us-china-new-analysis-venture-capital-finance/\n\nSource 5:\nI returned to Sydney in 2016 from a stint abroad in the U.K. and U.S. because I believed that a new generation of Silicon Valley-style technology companies was about to break out in Australia. Fast forward to 2024, and we need only look at global success stories such as Canva, A Cloud Guru, Linktree, Afterpay, Go1, SafetyCulture, and many others to see that a world-class startup ecosystem has emerged Down Under that is producing generational companies at an accelerating pace.\n\nAs recently as five years ago, sophisticated Limited Partners (LPs) had justifiable reservations about the Australian venture opportunity. The scale of potential outcomes was unclear given a constrained local market and cash returns were nascent. Instead, they placed “safer” bets in other markets (mainly the U.S., China, and Israel). However, increasing fund sizes, stricter regulations, and geopolitical tensions now pose challenges to returns in these classic venture markets.\n\nToday, top Australian managers can show world-class liquidity generated by capital-efficient companies operating at a global scale from a First World, stable democracy—and the world’s most sophisticated LPs are actively leaning in.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/11/australia-startup-scene-liquidity-us-china-new-analysis-venture-capital-finance/\n\nSource 6:\nThis is a bit silly and yet something I think a lot of people can relate to.\n\nMany years ago, just before bitcoin took off, I had gotten a bonus, and I heavily considered using this extra cash to invest in this brand-new thing.

But international students are already facing tougher English language standards, visa rejections are becoming more common and some private colleges are being told to stop recruiting fake overseas students within six months or they’ll lose their licenses.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/17/u-k-government-is-targetting-international-students-to-rein-in-surging-immigration-and-its-working/\n\nSource 4:\nIn search of greener pastures\n\nPeople choose to move to Down Under because of its warm weather, low visa barrier and English fluency, among other reasons. Besides lifestyle reasons, Australia has also ranked among the top countries for highly skilled talent <https://www.insead.edu/system/files/2023-11/gtci-2023-report.pdf> in past studies, thanks to its job opportunities. The country has risen from seventh in BCG’s list to first in 10 years.\n\nThe findings come at a time when the U.K. and Australia are overhauling <https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-67609963> their immigration system to tighten the criteria for those looking to enter the country. Britain has seen its fair share of struggles attracting inter-Europe talent following Brexit. \n\nHowever, labor shortages pose a real threat, which immigration helps address. In 2022, the U.K. had a record surge in arrivals <https://reuters.com/world/uk/net-migration-uk-hits-record-606000-2022-2023-05-25/> amid global conflicts and a talent shortfall.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/04/24/london-international-talent-magnet-amsterdam-new-york-dubai-australia-bcg-report/\n\nSource 5:\nPublicly available data speaks for itself and comes as a surprise to many. If we add up the liquid value of venture-backed M&A and IPO outcomes over the past decade, Australia comes in third (behind the U.S. and China) in total liquidity. Based on our findings from Dealroom.co and IMF World Economic Outlook data in 2024, this has occurred despite Australia remaining an underserved market, with venture capital investment accounting for only 0.18% of GDP in Australia, compared to 0.27% in China, 0.55% in the U.S., 0.64% in the U.K., and 0.77% in Israel.\n\nHow has this happened?\n\nLimited capital, population size, and the tyranny of distance were once seen as barriers for Australian startups with global ambitions. Those dynamics have now converged into the region’s competitive advantage, as knowing how to do more with less is a breeding ground for capital-efficient companies.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/11/australia-startup-scene-liquidity-us-china-new-analysis-venture-capital-finance/\n\nSource 5:\nI returned to Sydney in 2016 from a stint abroad in the U.K. and U.S. because I believed that a new generation of Silicon Valley-style technology companies was about to break out in Australia. Fast forward to 2024, and we need only look at global success stories such as Canva, A Cloud Guru, Linktree, Afterpay, Go1, SafetyCulture, and many others to see that a world-class startup ecosystem has emerged Down Under that is producing generational companies at an accelerating pace.\n\nAs recently as five years ago, sophisticated Limited Partners (LPs) had justifiable reservations about the Australian venture opportunity. The scale of potential outcomes was unclear given a constrained local market and cash returns were nascent. Instead, they placed “safer” bets in other markets (mainly the U.S., China, and Israel). However, increasing fund sizes, stricter regulations, and geopolitical tensions now pose challenges to returns in these classic venture markets.\n\nToday, top Australian managers can show world-class liquidity generated by capital-efficient companies operating at a global scale from a First World, stable democracy—and the world’s most sophisticated LPs are actively leaning in.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/11/australia-startup-scene-liquidity-us-china-new-analysis-venture-capital-finance/\n\nSource 6:\nThis is a bit silly and yet something I think a lot of people can relate to.\n\nMany years ago, just before bitcoin took off, I had gotten a bonus, and I heavily considered using this extra cash to invest in this brand-new thing. But having talked to friends and family, I concluded that it was probably too risky and a short-lived trend, so instead I chose to buy some huge new rims for my car at the time, a black Seat Leon. They looked cool, but they made the car quite uncomfortable to drive and six months later I watched as bitcoin skyrocketed.\n\nIf you have children, what does your childcare arrangements look like?\n\nI am away from home a lot, but my wife is self-employed, works as a yoga instructor and drives a business with a friend. This means she has the freedom to be at home, which she really likes, as it allows her to be there for our kids aged 10 and 12.\n\nWe’ve followed this model since we moved abroad about a decade ago, and it works well for us.\n\nWhat are your living arrangements like?
