As a result, the company’s crypto assets have appreciated in value. Likewise, FTX’s shares in the AI startup Anthropic have also appreciated in value, and were sold for more than $880 million <https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/25/ftx-to-sell-884m-of-anthropic-shares-to-two-dozen-institutional-investors/>.

The token, however, is trading at around $148 at the time of publication. \n\nThese deals have outraged some victims, including Sunil Kavuri, who criticized Bankman-Fried’s “continuous lie that we will all be made full” at his sentencing.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/05/08/ftx-customers-will-get-their-money-back-and-more-but-the-biggest-winners-are-bankruptcy-traders/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/05/08/ftx-customers-will-get-their-money-back-and-more-but-the-biggest-winners-are-bankruptcy-traders/\n\nSource 3:\nFrom crush to collapse\n\nOnce valued at over $30 billion, the rapid failure of FTX in November 2022 captured public attention thanks to its larger-than-life characters and eye-popping dollar figures. Much of the fascination focused on the relationships between the close cadre of friends in their late twenties and early thirties who ran the crypto empire, including Bankman-Fried and Ellison, many of whom dated each other. By the time of the trial, all had turned on Bankman-Fried, whose response included leaking Ellison’s private diary to the New York Times.\nAs the CEO of Alameda Research, Ellison played a critical role in FTX and admitted to prosecutors that she was aware—and facilitated—Bankman-Fried’s ploy to funnel billions of dollars of customer funds to his own investments, including in startups <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/09/sam-bankman-fried-trial-500-million-anthropic-investment-ai-claude/>, political donations <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/16/ftx-straw-donor-sam-bankman-fried-nishad-singh/>, and luxury real estate <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/01/17/ftx-just-released-new-details-lavish-spending-253-million-luxury-bahamian-real-estate/>. Still, in her sentencing memo, her lawyers argue that much of her bad judgment stemmed from her long-term relationship with Bankman-Fried, which began while they were both working at the trading firm Jane Street.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/09/11/sam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-adderall-ftx-sentencing/\n\nSource 4:\nBankman-Fried was her \'Kryptonite\'\n\nEllison\'s downfall has become the subject of morbid fascination over the past two years, as the public has picked over the collapse of FTX, once valued at $32 billion, and its inner circle of 20 and 30-something executives, many of whom dated or counted each other as lifelong friends. \n\nEllison joined Bankman-Fried\'s orbit as a trader at his hedge fund Alameda Research at just 24 years old, and soon becoming its CEO. As she acknowledged during three days of emotional testimony during Bankman-Fried\'s trial last fall, she also played a crucial role in the fraud that took down the empire, with FTX funneling billions in dollars of customer assets to fund disastrous trades at Alameda, along with luxury real estate, illegal campaign donations, and venture investments.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ellison admitted once again that she should have stopped the fraud sooner, but she was unable to, drawn in by what she describes as her admiration—and often unrequited love—of Bankman-Fried. "I\'m sorry I wasn\'t brave," she said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/09/24/caroline-ellison-ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-sentencing/\n\nSource 5:\nA representative for Bankman-Fried declined to comment. \n\nBankman-Fried wasn’t able to recognize any possibility that Bitcoin might go down, according to Silver. He “literally [said] ‘hey, if you aren\'t willing to risk ruining your life then, you\'re a wimp, and you\'re doing it wrong,’” Silver added, recalling an interview before the events that would lead to his arrest. \n\nIn another interview in the Bahamas <https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/11/22/sbf-ftx-bahamas-house-lifestyle/> in December 2022, after Bankman-Fried had already stepped down as FTX’s CEO and handed the company over to bankruptcy <https://apnews.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud-timeline-be13e3fc0e074e2edd50ba59d1f8960e> lawyers, he maintained access to the exchange’s live trading records. “This cannot get out right now,” Bankman-Fried told Silver.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/nate-silver-sam-bankman-fried-sam-altman-openai-ftx-ai/\n\nSource 5:\nFor his take on FTX, he conducted a series of previously unreleased interviews with its founder over Zoom <https://fortune.com/company/zoom/>, in the Bahamas where Bankman-Fried lived and FTX was headquartered, during a dinner in Manhattan at the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park, and at his parents’ home in Stanford, Calif., as he prepared for his ill-fated trial. Silver details Bankman-Fried’s risk tolerance and state of mind during those fateful days while also finding him to be reckless and seemingly unaware of the gravity of his actions. \n\n“It\'s the combination of being actually not all that great at risk assessment to be euphemistic—I mean terrible at risk assessment—and being willing to gamble it all that was very destructive and having this bizarre cult of personality around him,” Silver told Fortune. \n\nThroughout the book, he shares numerous examples of Bankman-Fried’s unique combination of bluster, delusion, and radical commitment to trying to measure the odds of everything around him that ultimately doomed him. \n\n“The irony is that Sam is actually not a very good calculator of odds,” Silver said in an interview.\n\nWilling to risk everything\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/nate-silver-sam-bankman-fried-sam-altman-openai-ftx-ai/\n\nSource 6:\nBankman-Fried, Salame, and other accomplices, such as Caroline Ellison, betrayed their trust when they conspired to plug holes in their risky speculation with funds FTX was supposed to hold as a custodian. \n\nWorse, Bankman-Fried repeatedly attempted <https://fortune.com/2022/11/16/ftx-bankruptcy-alameda-research-sbf-sam-bankman-fried-customer-deposits-scandal-lehman-bernie-madoff/.> to deflect criticism and portray his fraud in a more flattering light. \n\nSalame’s boss was eventually sentenced <https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/03/28/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crypto-sentencing-conviction-kaplan/> to 25 years behind bars. \n\nNot everyone cared for Salame’s tongue-in-cheek humor, however. \n\nWisconsin-based public relations professional Jeremy Tunis <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeremytunis_a-pr-case-study-from-ryan-salame-in-how-to-activity-7250265289227968512-EWqY> called the post a case study in “how to generate zero sympathy.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/11/ftx-linkedin-ryan-salame-prison/\n\nSource 7:\nAttorney Anjan Sahni asked the judge to spare his client from prison, citing “unusual circumstances,” including her off-and-on romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried and the damage caused when her “whole professional and personal life came to revolve” around him.\n\nFTX was one of the world\'s most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, known for its Superbowl TV ad and its extensive lobbying campaign in Washington, before it collapsed in 2022.\n\nU.S. prosecutors accused Bankman-Fried and other top executives of looting customer accounts on the exchange to make risky investments, make millions of dollars of illegal political donations, bribe Chinese officials and buy luxury real estate in the Caribbean.\n\nEllison was chief executive at Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency hedge fund controlled by Bankman-Fried that was used to process some customer funds from FTX.\n\nAs the business began to falter, Ellison divulged the massive fraud to employees who worked for her even before FTX filed for bankruptcy <https://apnews.com/article/ftx-bankruptcy-binance-timeline-c519d50b9059aa8bff0ce8b6cd26c40e>, trial evidence showed.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/caroline-ellison-ftx-prison-sam-bankman-fried/\n\nSource 8:\n“They kind of created their own bubble market,” a Nassau-based property appraiser told Bloomberg, which published a report describing <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-23/return-to-crypto-isle-sbf-s-30-million-bahamas-crash-pad-to-hit-the-market?sref=2jPYL79S> recent efforts to sell the 52 condos and offices that FTX executives spent $255 million to acquire. The report also provides some gaudy details about the style in which Bankman-Fried and his pals—who you may recall professed not to care about material things—liked to live. Here is a description of the Albany enclave where most made their home:\n\n"Everyone at FTX seemed to want a piece of this veritable gated town for the super rich with residents-only pools, racquetball courts and private restaurants.

As a result, the company’s crypto assets have appreciated in value.

The token, however, is trading at around $148 at the time of publication. \n\nThese deals have outraged some victims, including Sunil Kavuri, who criticized Bankman-Fried’s “continuous lie that we will all be made full” at his sentencing.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/05/08/ftx-customers-will-get-their-money-back-and-more-but-the-biggest-winners-are-bankruptcy-traders/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/05/08/ftx-customers-will-get-their-money-back-and-more-but-the-biggest-winners-are-bankruptcy-traders/\n\nSource 3:\nFrom crush to collapse\n\nOnce valued at over $30 billion, the rapid failure of FTX in November 2022 captured public attention thanks to its larger-than-life characters and eye-popping dollar figures. Much of the fascination focused on the relationships between the close cadre of friends in their late twenties and early thirties who ran the crypto empire, including Bankman-Fried and Ellison, many of whom dated each other. By the time of the trial, all had turned on Bankman-Fried, whose response included leaking Ellison’s private diary to the New York Times.\nAs the CEO of Alameda Research, Ellison played a critical role in FTX and admitted to prosecutors that she was aware—and facilitated—Bankman-Fried’s ploy to funnel billions of dollars of customer funds to his own investments, including in startups <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/09/sam-bankman-fried-trial-500-million-anthropic-investment-ai-claude/>, political donations <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/16/ftx-straw-donor-sam-bankman-fried-nishad-singh/>, and luxury real estate <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/01/17/ftx-just-released-new-details-lavish-spending-253-million-luxury-bahamian-real-estate/>. Still, in her sentencing memo, her lawyers argue that much of her bad judgment stemmed from her long-term relationship with Bankman-Fried, which began while they were both working at the trading firm Jane Street.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/09/11/sam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-adderall-ftx-sentencing/\n\nSource 4:\nBankman-Fried was her \'Kryptonite\'\n\nEllison\'s downfall has become the subject of morbid fascination over the past two years, as the public has picked over the collapse of FTX, once valued at $32 billion, and its inner circle of 20 and 30-something executives, many of whom dated or counted each other as lifelong friends. \n\nEllison joined Bankman-Fried\'s orbit as a trader at his hedge fund Alameda Research at just 24 years old, and soon becoming its CEO. As she acknowledged during three days of emotional testimony during Bankman-Fried\'s trial last fall, she also played a crucial role in the fraud that took down the empire, with FTX funneling billions in dollars of customer assets to fund disastrous trades at Alameda, along with luxury real estate, illegal campaign donations, and venture investments.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ellison admitted once again that she should have stopped the fraud sooner, but she was unable to, drawn in by what she describes as her admiration—and often unrequited love—of Bankman-Fried. "I\'m sorry I wasn\'t brave," she said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/09/24/caroline-ellison-ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-sentencing/\n\nSource 5:\nA representative for Bankman-Fried declined to comment. \n\nBankman-Fried wasn’t able to recognize any possibility that Bitcoin might go down, according to Silver.

As a result, claims will be repaid with interest.\n\nJohn Ray, FTX’s CEO who replaced Sam Bankman-Fried, who is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence <https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/03/28/sam-bankman-fried-sentencing-crisis-liquidity-fraud-ftx-crypto-exchange/>, has been in charge of cobbling together the estate\'s assets. “John and the team absolutely crushed it,” Thomas Braziel, a broker at 117 Partners who buys FTX claims on behalf of some of the largest hedge funds in the market, told Fortune.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/05/08/ftx-customers-will-get-their-money-back-and-more-but-the-biggest-winners-are-bankruptcy-traders/\n\nSource 2:\nLouis d’Origny, founder of claims buying platform FTX Creditor, who bet his personal funds on a full recovery, and set to profit over $25 million. He says he’s “incredibly, pleasantly surprised" with the announcement. Ray has sold “everything that wasn’t nailed down to the floor,” he said.\n\nThe lucrative recovery is partially due to the crypto market\'s renewal since 2022, with Bitcoin up over 190% since the exchange went bust. As a result, the company’s crypto assets have appreciated in value. Likewise, FTX’s shares in the AI startup Anthropic have also appreciated in value, and were sold for more than $880 million <https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/25/ftx-to-sell-884m-of-anthropic-shares-to-two-dozen-institutional-investors/>.

The bankruptcy administrators overseeing FTX’s estate sold SOL <https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/01/30/solana-anza-new-legal-entity-third-of-employees-decentralization-theater/> at $64 per token, sources close to the matter told Bloomberg, raising up to $1.9 billion for the estate. The token, however, is trading at around $148 at the time of publication. \n\nThese deals have outraged some victims, including Sunil Kavuri, who criticized Bankman-Fried’s “continuous lie that we will all be made full” at his sentencing.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/05/08/ftx-customers-will-get-their-money-back-and-more-but-the-biggest-winners-are-bankruptcy-traders/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/05/08/ftx-customers-will-get-their-money-back-and-more-but-the-biggest-winners-are-bankruptcy-traders/\n\nSource 3:\nFrom crush to collapse\n\nOnce valued at over $30 billion, the rapid failure of FTX in November 2022 captured public attention thanks to its larger-than-life characters and eye-popping dollar figures. Much of the fascination focused on the relationships between the close cadre of friends in their late twenties and early thirties who ran the crypto empire, including Bankman-Fried and Ellison, many of whom dated each other. By the time of the trial, all had turned on Bankman-Fried, whose response included leaking Ellison’s private diary to the New York Times.\nAs the CEO of Alameda Research, Ellison played a critical role in FTX and admitted to prosecutors that she was aware—and facilitated—Bankman-Fried’s ploy to funnel billions of dollars of customer funds to his own investments, including in startups <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/09/sam-bankman-fried-trial-500-million-anthropic-investment-ai-claude/>, political donations <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/16/ftx-straw-donor-sam-bankman-fried-nishad-singh/>, and luxury real estate <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/01/17/ftx-just-released-new-details-lavish-spending-253-million-luxury-bahamian-real-estate/>. Still, in her sentencing memo, her lawyers argue that much of her bad judgment stemmed from her long-term relationship with Bankman-Fried, which began while they were both working at the trading firm Jane Street.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/09/11/sam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-adderall-ftx-sentencing/\n\nSource 4:\nBankman-Fried was her \'Kryptonite\'\n\nEllison\'s downfall has become the subject of morbid fascination over the past two years, as the public has picked over the collapse of FTX, once valued at $32 billion, and its inner circle of 20 and 30-something executives, many of whom dated or counted each other as lifelong friends. \n\nEllison joined Bankman-Fried\'s orbit as a trader at his hedge fund Alameda Research at just 24 years old, and soon becoming its CEO. As she acknowledged during three days of emotional testimony during Bankman-Fried\'s trial last fall, she also played a crucial role in the fraud that took down the empire, with FTX funneling billions in dollars of customer assets to fund disastrous trades at Alameda, along with luxury real estate, illegal campaign donations, and venture investments.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ellison admitted once again that she should have stopped the fraud sooner, but she was unable to, drawn in by what she describes as her admiration—and often unrequited love—of Bankman-Fried. "I\'m sorry I wasn\'t brave," she said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/09/24/caroline-ellison-ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-sentencing/\n\nSource 5:\nA representative for Bankman-Fried declined to comment. \n\nBankman-Fried wasn’t able to recognize any possibility that Bitcoin might go down, according to Silver. He “literally [said] ‘hey, if you aren\'t willing to risk ruining your life then, you\'re a wimp, and you\'re doing it wrong,’” Silver added, recalling an interview before the events that would lead to his arrest. \n\nIn another interview in the Bahamas <https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/11/22/sbf-ftx-bahamas-house-lifestyle/> in December 2022, after Bankman-Fried had already stepped down as FTX’s CEO and handed the company over to bankruptcy <https://apnews.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud-timeline-be13e3fc0e074e2edd50ba59d1f8960e> lawyers, he maintained access to the exchange’s live trading records. “This cannot get out right now,” Bankman-Fried told Silver.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/nate-silver-sam-bankman-fried-sam-altman-openai-ftx-ai/\n\nSource 5:\nFor his take on FTX, he conducted a series of previously unreleased interviews with its founder over Zoom <https://fortune.com/company/zoom/>, in the Bahamas where Bankman-Fried lived and FTX was headquartered, during a dinner in Manhattan at the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park, and at his parents’ home in Stanford, Calif., as he prepared for his ill-fated trial. Silver details Bankman-Fried’s risk tolerance and state of mind during those fateful days while also finding him to be reckless and seemingly unaware of the gravity of his actions. \n\n“It\'s the combination of being actually not all that great at risk assessment to be euphemistic—I mean terrible at risk assessment—and being willing to gamble it all that was very destructive and having this bizarre cult of personality around him,” Silver told Fortune. \n\nThroughout the book, he shares numerous examples of Bankman-Fried’s unique combination of bluster, delusion, and radical commitment to trying to measure the odds of everything around him that ultimately doomed him. \n\n“The irony is that Sam is actually not a very good calculator of odds,” Silver said in an interview.\n\nWilling to risk everything\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/nate-silver-sam-bankman-fried-sam-altman-openai-ftx-ai/\n\nSource 6:\nBankman-Fried, Salame, and other accomplices, such as Caroline Ellison, betrayed their trust when they conspired to plug holes in their risky speculation with funds FTX was supposed to hold as a custodian. \n\nWorse, Bankman-Fried repeatedly attempted <https://fortune.com/2022/11/16/ftx-bankruptcy-alameda-research-sbf-sam-bankman-fried-customer-deposits-scandal-lehman-bernie-madoff/.> to deflect criticism and portray his fraud in a more flattering light. \n\nSalame’s boss was eventually sentenced <https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/03/28/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crypto-sentencing-conviction-kaplan/> to 25 years behind bars. \n\nNot everyone cared for Salame’s tongue-in-cheek humor, however. \n\nWisconsin-based public relations professional Jeremy Tunis <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeremytunis_a-pr-case-study-from-ryan-salame-in-how-to-activity-7250265289227968512-EWqY> called the post a case study in “how to generate zero sympathy.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/11/ftx-linkedin-ryan-salame-prison/\n\nSource 7:\nAttorney Anjan Sahni asked the judge to spare his client from prison, citing “unusual circumstances,” including her off-and-on romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried and the damage caused when her “whole professional and personal life came to revolve” around him.\n\nFTX was one of the world\'s most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, known for its Superbowl TV ad and its extensive lobbying campaign in Washington, before it collapsed in 2022.\n\nU.S. prosecutors accused Bankman-Fried and other top executives of looting customer accounts on the exchange to make risky investments, make millions of dollars of illegal political donations, bribe Chinese officials and buy luxury real estate in the Caribbean.\n\nEllison was chief executive at Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency hedge fund controlled by Bankman-Fried that was used to process some customer funds from FTX.\n\nAs the business began to falter, Ellison divulged the massive fraud to employees who worked for her even before FTX filed for bankruptcy <https://apnews.com/article/ftx-bankruptcy-binance-timeline-c519d50b9059aa8bff0ce8b6cd26c40e>, trial evidence showed.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/caroline-ellison-ftx-prison-sam-bankman-fried/\n\nSource 8:\n“They kind of created their own bubble market,” a Nassau-based property appraiser told Bloomberg, which published a report describing <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-23/return-to-crypto-isle-sbf-s-30-million-bahamas-crash-pad-to-hit-the-market?sref=2jPYL79S> recent efforts to sell the 52 condos and offices that FTX executives spent $255 million to acquire. The report also provides some gaudy details about the style in which Bankman-Fried and his pals—who you may recall professed not to care about material things—liked to live. Here is a description of the Albany enclave where most made their home:\n\n"Everyone at FTX seemed to want a piece of this veritable gated town for the super rich with residents-only pools, racquetball courts and private restaurants.
