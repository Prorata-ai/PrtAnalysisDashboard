Goltermann noted there are two main reasons for this phenomenon. First, because of Japan’s low interest rates, the yen is often used in the so-called “carry trade.” That’s when investors borrow at a low interest rate to invest in an asset with a higher return. \n\nFor example, a fund manager might borrow yen and then invest that money in Indian bonds that offer a higher yield, pocketing the difference. It’s slightly more complex than this in practice, as the fund manager in question would also need to swap rupees for dollars, and hedge his dollar risk, but that’s the general idea. \n\nAll of this means that when the interest-rate differentials between Japan and other major developed nations are high, traders will rush in to borrow yen for the carry trade, which weighs on the currency.

Goltermann noted there are two main reasons for this phenomenon. First, because of Japan’s low interest rates, the yen is often used in the so-called “carry trade.” That’s when investors borrow at a low interest rate to invest in an asset with a higher return. \n\nFor example, a fund manager might borrow yen and then invest that money in Indian bonds that offer a higher yield, pocketing the difference.

Goltermann noted there are two main reasons for this phenomenon. First, because of Japan’s low interest rates, the yen is often used in the so-called “carry trade.” That’s when investors borrow at a low interest rate to invest in an asset with a higher return. \n\nFor example, a fund manager might borrow yen and then invest that money in Indian bonds that offer a higher yield, pocketing the difference. It’s slightly more complex than this in practice, as the fund manager in question would also need to swap rupees for dollars, and hedge his dollar risk, but that’s the general idea. \n\nAll of this means that when the interest-rate differentials between Japan and other major developed nations are high, traders will rush in to borrow yen for the carry trade, which weighs on the currency.

Goltermann noted there are two main reasons for this phenomenon. First, because of Japan’s low interest rates, the yen is often used in the so-called “carry trade.” That’s when investors borrow at a low interest rate to invest in an asset with a higher return. \n\nFor example, a fund manager might borrow yen and then invest that money in Indian bonds that offer a higher yield, pocketing the difference.

When asked by reporters if they had stepped into markets to prop up the yen, Japan’s top currency official said <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-29/japan-s-kanda-says-no-comment-for-now-when-asked-if-intervened-lvkjpf54> “No comment for now.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/29/japan-central-bank-intervene-currency-markets-yen-34-year-low/\n\nSource 4:\nThe yen briefly touched a 34-year low compared to the U.S. dollar this week. And even after rising on Monday, perhaps due to an undisclosed intervention from the Bank of Japan, the dollar is now worth more than 157 Japanese yen, compared to just 129 in January of 2023. There are several reasons for the yen’s underperformance compared to the dollar, but the main one is clear: rising U.S. interest rates. \n\n“The key lesson from Japan’s travails with the yen over the past couple years is that what matters most to the currency’s fortunes is expected interest rate differentials,” Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief market economist at Capital Economics, explained in a Monday note. \n\nThe phrase “expected interest rate differentials” may sound confusing, but it just means the anticipated difference between interest rates in Japan and other parts of the world, particularly the U.S.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/30/japan-currency-yen-cratering-stock-market-interest-rate-differentials-inflation/\n\nSource 4:\nWhen the U.S. or other western powers’ interest rates are higher than Japan’s, it puts pressure on the yen. Goltermann noted there are two main reasons for this phenomenon. First, because of Japan’s low interest rates, the yen is often used in the so-called “carry trade.” That’s when investors borrow at a low interest rate to invest in an asset with a higher return. \n\nFor example, a fund manager might borrow yen and then invest that money in Indian bonds that offer a higher yield, pocketing the difference. It’s slightly more complex than this in practice, as the fund manager in question would also need to swap rupees for dollars, and hedge his dollar risk, but that’s the general idea. \n\nAll of this means that when the interest-rate differentials between Japan and other major developed nations are high, traders will rush in to borrow yen for the carry trade, which weighs on the currency. And Bank of America’s analysts warned in a Friday note that the carry trade “is unlikely to start diminishing meaningfully until the Fed starts cutting rates, which our U.S. economists expect in December.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/30/japan-currency-yen-cratering-stock-market-interest-rate-differentials-inflation/\n\nSource 5:\nThe Bank of Japan increased interest rates in mid-March to 0-0.1%, ending the last remaining negative interest rate regime among major economies. Central bankers credited <https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/01/negative-interest-rates-30-year-slump-economists-optimistic-japan-back-data/> successful wage negotiations, where Japanese unions won their biggest pay increases <https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/japan-unions-will-unveil-results-wage-talks-presaging-shift-central-bank-2024-03-15> in over 30 years, for their decision to hike rates. \n\nIf Japan decides to hold off raising interest rates, that could create another problem <https://fortune.com/2024/04/30/japan-currency-yen-cratering-stock-market-interest-rate-differentials-inflation/>: a weak yen. \n\nThe Japanese yen has fallen to record low as the country's interest rates remain much lower than those offered by the U.S. A weak currency makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive; that's good for export-focused sectors like tourism and car manufacturing, but hurts households and industries that rely on imported inputs.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/05/16/japan-escaped-deflation-now-confronts-stagflation-risk-weak-gdp-growth-inflation-interest-rates/\n\nSource 6:\nWhat comes next?\n\nThe current drama over the yen may be far from over. Arindam Sandilya, JPMorgan’s co-head of global FX Strategy, told <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-06/jpmorgan-says-carry-trade-unwind-is-only-half-complete> Bloomberg TV on Tuesday that the carry trade unwind is only 50%–60% complete. Ntonifor estimated that the process will take another two to three months, although he added that the Bank of Japan is unlikely to institute further rate hikes.\n\nAs traders exit their positions, the yen could continue to gain in value, forcing other investors out and exacerbating the trend. Other wild cards could also come into play, including the U.S. election. Former president Donald Trump said <https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/07/26/economy/trump-weak-dollar/> in July that one of his second-term priorities is a weaker dollar relative to the yen, which some analysts say <https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20240718_31/> contributed to the Japanese currency’s rally.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/japan-carry-trade-yen-explainer-stock-market-wall-street/\n\nSource 6:\nAnd while Japan’s stock market index, the Nikkei, suffered <https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/investing/japan-nikkei-stock-rout-intl-hnk> its worst daily loss on Monday since 1987, a staggering rebound on Tuesday indicates that the Bank of Japan’s strategy could be working, with yens rushing back into the country. “You have inflows into Japanese assets, which will help Japan relative to the rest of the world,” Ntonifor told Fortune, arguing that investors have been undervaluing the yen.\n\nThe chart below shows the precipitous decline—and sudden rebound—of the Nikkei, matched by a drop in U.S. equity prices:\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/japan-carry-trade-yen-explainer-stock-market-wall-street/>\n\nWhat comes next?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/japan-carry-trade-yen-explainer-stock-market-wall-street/\n\nSource 7:\nThe sudden strengthening of the currency is particularly problematic for companies that have factored a weak yen into their profit estimates. Endoscope maker Olympus Corp. puts the dollar at ¥151 in the current financial year, and Mitsubishi Chemical Group Corp. assumes ¥150. \n\nRie Nishihara, chief Japan strategist at JPMorgan Securities, said a fifth of firms are assuming that the yen will weaken beyond ¥150 per dollar, raising the hurdle for them to meet guidance this financial year after the yen rebounded. That’s especially the case for companies that rely on foreign demand, according to a report this month.\n\nChina Malaise\n\nEarnings also showed many Japanese companies struggled in China.\n\n“Although the earnings results were pretty good because a weak yen supported exporters, they showed the tough conditions for business in China,” said Hiroyuki Ueno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co. “It’s clear that recovery there will take time.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/08/22/yen-appreciation-hurt-corporate-japan-record-profits-china-earnings-topix-shares/"}

There are several reasons for the yen’s underperformance compared to the dollar, but the main one is clear: rising U.S. interest rates. \n\n“The key lesson from Japan’s travails with the yen over the past couple years is that what matters most to the currency’s fortunes is expected interest rate differentials,” Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief market economist at Capital Economics, explained in a Monday note. \n\nThe phrase “expected interest rate differentials” may sound confusing, but it just means the anticipated difference between interest rates in Japan and other parts of the world, particularly the U.S.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/30/japan-currency-yen-cratering-stock-market-interest-rate-differentials-inflation/\n\nSource 4:\nWhen the U.S. or other western powers’ interest rates are higher than Japan’s, it puts pressure on the yen. Goltermann noted there are two main reasons for this phenomenon. First, because of Japan’s low interest rates, the yen is often used in the so-called “carry trade.” That’s when investors borrow at a low interest rate to invest in an asset with a higher return. \n\nFor example, a fund manager might borrow yen and then invest that money in Indian bonds that offer a higher yield, pocketing the difference. It’s slightly more complex than this in practice, as the fund manager in question would also need to swap rupees for dollars, and hedge his dollar risk, but that’s the general idea. \n\nAll of this means that when the interest-rate differentials between Japan and other major developed nations are high, traders will rush in to borrow yen for the carry trade, which weighs on the currency. And Bank of America’s analysts warned in a Friday note that the carry trade “is unlikely to start diminishing meaningfully until the Fed starts cutting rates, which our U.S. economists expect in December.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/30/japan-currency-yen-cratering-stock-market-interest-rate-differentials-inflation/\n\nSource 5:\nThe Bank of Japan increased interest rates in mid-March to 0-0.1%, ending the last remaining negative interest rate regime among major economies.

Arindam Sandilya, JPMorgan’s co-head of global FX Strategy, told <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-06/jpmorgan-says-carry-trade-unwind-is-only-half-complete> Bloomberg TV on Tuesday that the carry trade unwind is only 50%–60% complete. Ntonifor estimated that the process will take another two to three months, although he added that the Bank of Japan is unlikely to institute further rate hikes.\n\nAs traders exit their positions, the yen could continue to gain in value, forcing other investors out and exacerbating the trend. Other wild cards could also come into play, including the U.S. election. Former president Donald Trump said <https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/07/26/economy/trump-weak-dollar/> in July that one of his second-term priorities is a weaker dollar relative to the yen, which some analysts say <https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20240718_31/> contributed to the Japanese currency’s rally.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/japan-carry-trade-yen-explainer-stock-market-wall-street/\n\nSource 6:\nAnd while Japan’s stock market index, the Nikkei, suffered <https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/investing/japan-nikkei-stock-rout-intl-hnk> its worst daily loss on Monday since 1987, a staggering rebound on Tuesday indicates that the Bank of Japan’s strategy could be working, with yens rushing back into the country. “You have inflows into Japanese assets, which will help Japan relative to the rest of the world,” Ntonifor told Fortune, arguing that investors have been undervaluing the yen.\n\nThe chart below shows the precipitous decline—and sudden rebound—of the Nikkei, matched by a drop in U.S. equity prices:\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/japan-carry-trade-yen-explainer-stock-market-wall-street/>\n\nWhat comes next?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/japan-carry-trade-yen-explainer-stock-market-wall-street/\n\nSource 7:\nThe sudden strengthening of the currency is particularly problematic for companies that have factored a weak yen into their profit estimates.

That’s especially the case for companies that rely on foreign demand, according to a report this month.\n\nChina Malaise\n\nEarnings also showed many Japanese companies struggled in China.\n\n“Although the earnings results were pretty good because a weak yen supported exporters, they showed the tough conditions for business in China,” said Hiroyuki Ueno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co. “It’s clear that recovery there will take time.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/08/22/yen-appreciation-hurt-corporate-japan-record-profits-china-earnings-topix-shares/"}

Nobody had a firm view on what was transpiring, nor if official intervention had occurred. \n\n“It’s like everyone was scrambling to find out what’s going on, but everyone’s almost clueless,” said Wu at StoneX Financial. “It’s like watching a car-wreck that you’re just driving by.” \n\nThere was no rest either for Shoki Omori in Tokyo, who logged on to monitor the yen after his phone beeped with alerts that Japan’s currency had dropped to 160. \n\n“I was going to relax and enjoy the long weekend after having a super busy week with currency volatility and the BOJ’s monetary policy decision,” said Omori, chief desk strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. “Lunch is for wimps,” he said, adding he’s been glued to the screen since the surge in dollar-yen started. \n\nThings were similarly hectic in Sydney where Rodrigo Catril fielded a barrage of questions on the yen’s moves from clients to sales team members.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/29/japan-central-bank-intervene-currency-markets-yen-34-year-low/\n\nSource 3:\n“It has been crazy,” said Catril, strategist at National Australia Bank Ltd., who only managed to eat his lunch at close to 3 p.m. “Lots of people asking questions.” \n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/29/japan-central-bank-intervene-currency-markets-yen-34-year-low/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/29/japan-central-bank-intervene-currency-markets-yen-34-year-low/\n\nSource 3:\nExacerbating nervousness was thin liquidity due to a local public holiday, even as investors were on tenterhooks for official intervention to prop up a currency that’s wallowing at a 34-year low. \n\nSpeculation on what caused the swings has been rife. \n\nIG Markets said the yen’s sudden reversal from losses to gains had “all the hallmarks” of intervention.

Japan intervened in foreign exchange markets three times in 2022 to prop up its currency. \n\nLast week, Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. released a statement that acknowledged the two Asian countries’ “serious concerns” about the “recent sharp depreciation” of their currencies. \n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/25/fed-central-bankers-southeast-asia-time-rate-cuts-ensure-currencies-no-collapse/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/25/fed-central-bankers-southeast-asia-time-rate-cuts-ensure-currencies-no-collapse/\n\nSource 3:\nKyle Rodda was on the 34th floor of the Capital.com office in Melbourne when the yen suddenly plunged to around 160 per dollar early in the Asia day. The trading floor exploded. \n\n“It was much like a game of bingo — everyone shouting 160 all of a sudden,” said Rodda, a strategist who was sitting among six dealers who saw yen trading volumes surge to around five times more than normal. “Everyone was trying to buy the dip for the next push and trading was going both ways — it was pretty wild.” \n\nFrom Melbourne to Tokyo, market participants were scrambling to trade and make sense of swings in Japan’s embattled currency <https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/17/japan-trade-deficit-third-straight-year/> during one of its most volatile days in recent memory. The yen dropped by more than 1% <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-29/yen-slides-past-160-against-dollar-for-first-time-since-1990> in early trading, before U-turning to rally sharply by more than 2% by around 1 p.m. in Singapore.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/29/japan-central-bank-intervene-currency-markets-yen-34-year-low/\n\nSource 3:\nIn Singapore, currency trader Mingze Wu was on his sixth cup of tea for the day when the yen swung from losses to gains. Nobody had a firm view on what was transpiring, nor if official intervention had occurred. \n\n“It’s like everyone was scrambling to find out what’s going on, but everyone’s almost clueless,” said Wu at StoneX Financial. “It’s like watching a car-wreck that you’re just driving by.” \n\nThere was no rest either for Shoki Omori in Tokyo, who logged on to monitor the yen after his phone beeped with alerts that Japan’s currency had dropped to 160. \n\n“I was going to relax and enjoy the long weekend after having a super busy week with currency volatility and the BOJ’s monetary policy decision,” said Omori, chief desk strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. “Lunch is for wimps,” he said, adding he’s been glued to the screen since the surge in dollar-yen started. \n\nThings were similarly hectic in Sydney where Rodrigo Catril fielded a barrage of questions on the yen’s moves from clients to sales team members.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/29/japan-central-bank-intervene-currency-markets-yen-34-year-low/\n\nSource 3:\n“It has been crazy,” said Catril, strategist at National Australia Bank Ltd., who only managed to eat his lunch at close to 3 p.m. “Lots of people asking questions.” \n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/29/japan-central-bank-intervene-currency-markets-yen-34-year-low/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/29/japan-central-bank-intervene-currency-markets-yen-34-year-low/\n\nSource 3:\nExacerbating nervousness was thin liquidity due to a local public holiday, even as investors were on tenterhooks for official intervention to prop up a currency that’s wallowing at a 34-year low. \n\nSpeculation on what caused the swings has been rife. \n\nIG Markets said the yen’s sudden reversal from losses to gains had “all the hallmarks” of intervention. Not so, other Asia-based traders said. Mizuho Securities reckoned profit-taking turbocharged some of the rapid moves. \n\nAnd Japanese authorities <https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/01/negative-interest-rates-30-year-slump-economists-optimistic-japan-back-data/> didn’t help in explaining the big moves. When asked by reporters if they had stepped into markets to prop up the yen, Japan’s top currency official said <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-29/japan-s-kanda-says-no-comment-for-now-when-asked-if-intervened-lvkjpf54> “No comment for now.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/29/japan-central-bank-intervene-currency-markets-yen-34-year-low/\n\nSource 4:\nThe yen briefly touched a 34-year low compared to the U.S. dollar this week. And even after rising on Monday, perhaps due to an undisclosed intervention from the Bank of Japan, the dollar is now worth more than 157 Japanese yen, compared to just 129 in January of 2023. There are several reasons for the yen’s underperformance compared to the dollar, but the main one is clear: rising U.S. interest rates. \n\n“The key lesson from Japan’s travails with the yen over the past couple years is that what matters most to the currency’s fortunes is expected interest rate differentials,” Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief market economist at Capital Economics, explained in a Monday note. \n\nThe phrase “expected interest rate differentials” may sound confusing, but it just means the anticipated difference between interest rates in Japan and other parts of the world, particularly the U.S.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/30/japan-currency-yen-cratering-stock-market-interest-rate-differentials-inflation/\n\nSource 4:\nWhen the U.S. or other western powers’ interest rates are higher than Japan’s, it puts pressure on the yen. Goltermann noted there are two main reasons for this phenomenon. First, because of Japan’s low interest rates, the yen is often used in the so-called “carry trade.” That’s when investors borrow at a low interest rate to invest in an asset with a higher return. \n\nFor example, a fund manager might borrow yen and then invest that money in Indian bonds that offer a higher yield, pocketing the difference. It’s slightly more complex than this in practice, as the fund manager in question would also need to swap rupees for dollars, and hedge his dollar risk, but that’s the general idea. \n\nAll of this means that when the interest-rate differentials between Japan and other major developed nations are high, traders will rush in to borrow yen for the carry trade, which weighs on the currency. And Bank of America’s analysts warned in a Friday note that the carry trade “is unlikely to start diminishing meaningfully until the Fed starts cutting rates, which our U.S. economists expect in December.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/30/japan-currency-yen-cratering-stock-market-interest-rate-differentials-inflation/\n\nSource 5:\nThe Bank of Japan increased interest rates in mid-March to 0-0.1%, ending the last remaining negative interest rate regime among major economies. Central bankers credited <https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/01/negative-interest-rates-30-year-slump-economists-optimistic-japan-back-data/> successful wage negotiations, where Japanese unions won their biggest pay increases <https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/japan-unions-will-unveil-results-wage-talks-presaging-shift-central-bank-2024-03-15> in over 30 years, for their decision to hike rates. \n\nIf Japan decides to hold off raising interest rates, that could create another problem <https://fortune.com/2024/04/30/japan-currency-yen-cratering-stock-market-interest-rate-differentials-inflation/>: a weak yen. \n\nThe Japanese yen has fallen to record low as the country's interest rates remain much lower than those offered by the U.S. A weak currency makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive; that's good for export-focused sectors like tourism and car manufacturing, but hurts households and industries that rely on imported inputs.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/05/16/japan-escaped-deflation-now-confronts-stagflation-risk-weak-gdp-growth-inflation-interest-rates/\n\nSource 6:\nWhat comes next?\n\nThe current drama over the yen may be far from over. Arindam Sandilya, JPMorgan’s co-head of global FX Strategy, told <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-06/jpmorgan-says-carry-trade-unwind-is-only-half-complete> Bloomberg TV on Tuesday that the carry trade unwind is only 50%–60% complete. Ntonifor estimated that the process will take another two to three months, although he added that the Bank of Japan is unlikely to institute further rate hikes.\n\nAs traders exit their positions, the yen could continue to gain in value, forcing other investors out and exacerbating the trend. Other wild cards could also come into play, including the U.S. election. Former president Donald Trump said <https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/07/26/economy/trump-weak-dollar/> in July that one of his second-term priorities is a weaker dollar relative to the yen, which some analysts say <https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20240718_31/> contributed to the Japanese currency’s rally.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/japan-carry-trade-yen-explainer-stock-market-wall-street/\n\nSource 6:\nAnd while Japan’s stock market index, the Nikkei, suffered <https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/investing/japan-nikkei-stock-rout-intl-hnk> its worst daily loss on Monday since 1987, a staggering rebound on Tuesday indicates that the Bank of Japan’s strategy could be working, with yens rushing back into the country. “You have inflows into Japanese assets, which will help Japan relative to the rest of the world,” Ntonifor told Fortune, arguing that investors have been undervaluing the yen.\n\nThe chart below shows the precipitous decline—and sudden rebound—of the Nikkei, matched by a drop in U.S. equity prices:\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/japan-carry-trade-yen-explainer-stock-market-wall-street/>\n\nWhat comes next?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/japan-carry-trade-yen-explainer-stock-market-wall-street/\n\nSource 7:\nThe sudden strengthening of the currency is particularly problematic for companies that have factored a weak yen into their profit estimates. Endoscope maker Olympus Corp. puts the dollar at ¥151 in the current financial year, and Mitsubishi Chemical Group Corp. assumes ¥150. \n\nRie Nishihara, chief Japan strategist at JPMorgan Securities, said a fifth of firms are assuming that the yen will weaken beyond ¥150 per dollar, raising the hurdle for them to meet guidance this financial year after the yen rebounded. That’s especially the case for companies that rely on foreign demand, according to a report this month.\n\nChina Malaise\n\nEarnings also showed many Japanese companies struggled in China.\n\n“Although the earnings results were pretty good because a weak yen supported exporters, they showed the tough conditions for business in China,” said Hiroyuki Ueno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co. “It’s clear that recovery there will take time.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/08/22/yen-appreciation-hurt-corporate-japan-record-profits-china-earnings-topix-shares/"}
