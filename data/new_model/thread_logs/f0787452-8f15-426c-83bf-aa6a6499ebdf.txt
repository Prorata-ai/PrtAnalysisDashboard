As one of the game's premier -- and best-paid -- pass rushers, he gained notoriety for his ''sack dance,'' a manic bit of high stepping executed near the wreckage of quarterbacks he caught and crumbled. Now Gastineau, superstar, has become Gastineau, superscab. A name-brand player who crossed the picket line on the strike's first day, Gastineau, 30, attracted more attention than a goal-line fumble. Players on other teams vilified him -- ''He has an IQ of about room temperature'' is how Chicago Bears defensive lineman Dan Hampton delicately put it -- and his own teammates, peers now picketers, made no effort to conceal their anger.

''And at times it appears he is more concerned with publicity than playing football.'' Since Gastineau arrived in the league in 1979, he has not been modest about his abilities, nor has he needed to be. Possessing frightening speed on a chassis that is Muscle Beach prime, he makes opposing quarterbacks feel as though they are being pursued by a rock slide. In his first season as a starter, in 1980, he mashed opposing quarterbacks 11 1/2 times (the half means a teammate joined him in the kill). The next year he led the league in sacks with 20; following the strike-shortened 1982 season, he again led the league in 1983. In 1984 he had 22 sacks, an NFL record. His play brought him a $4-million contract ($725,000 a year plus incentives), with a lifestyle to match.

Since Gastineau arrived in the league in 1979, he has not been modest about his abilities, nor has he needed to be. Possessing frightening speed on a chassis that is Muscle Beach prime, he makes opposing quarterbacks feel as though they are being pursued by a rock slide. In his first season as a starter, in 1980, he mashed opposing quarterbacks 11 1/2 times (the half means a teammate joined him in the kill). The next year he led the league in sacks with 20; following the strike-shortened 1982 season, he again led the league in 1983. In 1984 he had 22 sacks, an NFL record. His play brought him a $4-million contract ($725,000 a year plus incentives), with a lifestyle to match.

Possessing frightening speed on a chassis that is Muscle Beach prime, he makes opposing quarterbacks feel as though they are being pursued by a rock slide. In his first season as a starter, in 1980, he mashed opposing quarterbacks 11 1/2 times (the half means a teammate joined him in the kill). The next year he led the league in sacks with 20; following the strike-shortened 1982 season, he again led the league in 1983. In 1984 he had 22 sacks, an NFL record. His play brought him a $4-million contract ($725,000 a year plus incentives), with a lifestyle to match.

Jones said no, brought in a new network <https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2018/12/13/18137938/nfl-fox-deal-rupert-murdoch-1993-john-madden-terry-bradshaw-howie-long-jimmy-johnson-cbs-nbc> called Fox, and started a bidding war.\n\nWhen Jones fought back against the rebate, he was a new owner after buying the Cowboys in 1989 for $140 million. It’s now worth billions. There are now new owners looking to make their own mark.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/06/29/nfl-sunday-ticket-antitrust-lawsuit-ruling-tv-rights-revenue-teams/>', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.5955158), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='4090aa22-0bcb-4cf2-b8a0-5f8f6d769e47', embedding=None, metadata={'id': '3594e4ac2c27afabfe7d6b4b612c3fe3fb88b85056db8044fdb8b964de82d0c9-49', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': '3594e4ac2c27afabfe7d6b4b612c3fe3fb88b85056db8044fdb8b964de82d0c9', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20241028, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-07', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Iger-Barra-Hill.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2024, 'date_month': 10, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/2024/10/28/ceos-climb-entry-level-corner-office-entire-career/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 28, 'title': 'Nike’s CEO climbed from intern to the corner office.

As one of the game's premier -- and best-paid -- pass rushers, he gained notoriety for his ''sack dance,'' a manic bit of high stepping executed near the wreckage of quarterbacks he caught and crumbled. Now Gastineau, superstar, has become Gastineau, superscab. A name-brand player who crossed the picket line on the strike's first day, Gastineau, 30, attracted more attention than a goal-line fumble. Players on other teams vilified him -- ''He has an IQ of about room temperature'' is how Chicago Bears defensive lineman Dan Hampton delicately put it -- and his own teammates, peers now picketers, made no effort to conceal their anger.

''And at times it appears he is more concerned with publicity than playing football.'' Since Gastineau arrived in the league in 1979, he has not been modest about his abilities, nor has he needed to be. Possessing frightening speed on a chassis that is Muscle Beach prime, he makes opposing quarterbacks feel as though they are being pursued by a rock slide. In his first season as a starter, in 1980, he mashed opposing quarterbacks 11 1/2 times (the half means a teammate joined him in the kill). The next year he led the league in sacks with 20; following the strike-shortened 1982 season, he again led the league in 1983. In 1984 he had 22 sacks, an NFL record. His play brought him a $4-million contract ($725,000 a year plus incentives), with a lifestyle to match.

As one of the game's premier -- and best-paid -- pass rushers, he gained notoriety for his ''sack dance,'' a manic bit of high stepping executed near the wreckage of quarterbacks he caught and crumbled. Now Gastineau, superstar, has become Gastineau, superscab. A name-brand player who crossed the picket line on the strike's first day, Gastineau, 30, attracted more attention than a goal-line fumble. Players on other teams vilified him -- ''He has an IQ of about room temperature'' is how Chicago Bears defensive lineman Dan Hampton delicately put it -- and his own teammates, peers now picketers, made no effort to conceal their anger. A contest pitting a bunch of well-compensated, no-neck entertainers against a millionaire boys' club for possession of the nation's fall sporting ritual is\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-life-of-a-725000-scab-fortune-classics-1987/\n\nSource 2:\nhas always been a flamboyant person who craved the limelight,'' says Kurt Sohn, the Jets shop steward and wide receiver. ''And at times it appears he is more concerned with publicity than playing football.'' Since Gastineau arrived in the league in 1979, he has not been modest about his abilities, nor has he needed to be. Possessing frightening speed on a chassis that is Muscle Beach prime, he makes opposing quarterbacks feel as though they are being pursued by a rock slide. In his first season as a starter, in 1980, he mashed opposing quarterbacks 11 1/2 times (the half means a teammate joined him in the kill). The next year he led the league in sacks with 20; following the strike-shortened 1982 season, he again led the league in 1983. In 1984 he had 22 sacks, an NFL record. His play brought him a $4-million contract ($725,000 a year plus incentives), with a lifestyle to match. Gastineau models for posters, endorses products, and exhibits the kind of flash once associated with a guy named Broadway Joe Namath. He tooled up to practice one day in a $156,000 Rolls-Royce\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-life-of-a-725000-scab-fortune-classics-1987/\n\nSource 3:\nRemember back in January when Elmo, of Sesame Street <https://fortune.com/tag/sesame-street/> fame, posted on X <https://x.com/elmo/status/1751995117366296904>, “Elmo is just checking in!

As one of the game's premier -- and best-paid -- pass rushers, he gained notoriety for his ''sack dance,'' a manic bit of high stepping executed near the wreckage of quarterbacks he caught and crumbled. Now Gastineau, superstar, has become Gastineau, superscab. A name-brand player who crossed the picket line on the strike's first day, Gastineau, 30, attracted more attention than a goal-line fumble. Players on other teams vilified him -- ''He has an IQ of about room temperature'' is how Chicago Bears defensive lineman Dan Hampton delicately put it -- and his own teammates, peers now picketers, made no effort to conceal their anger. A contest pitting a bunch of well-compensated, no-neck entertainers against a millionaire boys' club for possession of the nation's fall sporting ritual is\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-life-of-a-725000-scab-fortune-classics-1987/\n\nSource 2:\nhas always been a flamboyant person who craved the limelight,'' says Kurt Sohn, the Jets shop steward and wide receiver. ''And at times it appears he is more concerned with publicity than playing football.'' Since Gastineau arrived in the league in 1979, he has not been modest about his abilities, nor has he needed to be. Possessing frightening speed on a chassis that is Muscle Beach prime, he makes opposing quarterbacks feel as though they are being pursued by a rock slide. In his first season as a starter, in 1980, he mashed opposing quarterbacks 11 1/2 times (the half means a teammate joined him in the kill). The next year he led the league in sacks with 20; following the strike-shortened 1982 season, he again led the league in 1983. In 1984 he had 22 sacks, an NFL record. His play brought him a $4-million contract ($725,000 a year plus incentives), with a lifestyle to match. Gastineau models for posters, endorses products, and exhibits the kind of flash once associated with a guy named Broadway Joe Namath. He tooled up to practice one day in a $156,000 Rolls-Royce\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-life-of-a-725000-scab-fortune-classics-1987/\n\nSource 3:\nRemember back in January when Elmo, of Sesame Street <https://fortune.com/tag/sesame-street/> fame, posted on X <https://x.com/elmo/status/1751995117366296904>, “Elmo is just checking in!
