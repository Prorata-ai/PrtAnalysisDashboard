But here\'s the weird thing about Donald Trump: Try as he might to be a figure of ridiculous fun, lie as he might about things large and small, Trump appears to be an enormously skilled developer. Associates describe an unfailing knack for spotting and ferreting out waste; a memory like a Zip drive; a grasp of byzantine zoning laws so detailed that he routinely requires the city to close loopholes only he had the wherewithal (many would say gall) to exploit. There\'s Trump walking the construction sites every day, yelling that the concrete is the wrong kind, that the marble isn\'t flat enough, that the ceiling should be ripped out and redone. "He can look at a type of window glass and tell you what type it is and its energy-efficiency rating," says a former employee. Then, too, Trump brings the sheer power of his persona to bear.

I even called a psychiatrist to get his clinical assessment of Trump. (He suggested an overmastering need to escape the shadow of his father, Fred, a successful outer-borough developer who died last year and whom Trump rarely mentions.) But the real puzzler is what, exactly, Donald Trump wants. As we walked through the half-gutted lobby of the General Motors <https://fortune.com/company/general-motors/> Building, Trump insisted he most wanted to be respected as a builder. "The thing I do best is I build," he said. "Everyone says, \'Oh, Trump is a great promoter.\' I don\'t think I\'m even a good promoter. You build a great product, it becomes successful." He paused to touch some tiny bronze fixtures. "See, these were all corroded—they looked disgusting," he said. "Now it\'s great, right?"

The group has been chopping away at Rockefeller\'s outside activities; at one memorable meeting, seven got the ax. (That still leaves him prominently involved with fifteen outside organizations.) Meanwhile, Rockefeller says, he has been focusing more sharply on how he can most efficiently use his time for the benefit of Chase. "I think it\'s a question of recognizing that I do have a finite remaining time at the bank." A case of "better late than never" perhaps, though maybe not soon enough. As things come down to the wire, Rockefeller does have one rather strong—and startling—asset: the emotions among the people who work for him.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.6100154), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='ed721ec6-68a5-4322-9532-e1f4abc79e9d', embedding=None, metadata={'id': '75ca1c35823332c6f3a51daea974d9573c1d5463c2b9e2071d19b6e3748c70ca-11', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': '75ca1c35823332c6f3a51daea974d9573c1d5463c2b9e2071d19b6e3748c70ca', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20040419, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-07', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tru19_b_13030465.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2004, 'date_month': 4, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/article/donald-trump-business-enterprise/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 19, 'title': 'Inside Donald Trump’s trophy life', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/article/donald-trump-business-enterprise/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Trump is no different.

Since Gastineau arrived in the league in 1979, he has not been modest about his abilities, nor has he needed to be. Possessing frightening speed on a chassis that is Muscle Beach prime, he makes opposing quarterbacks feel as though they are being pursued by a rock slide. In his first season as a starter, in 1980, he mashed opposing quarterbacks 11 1/2 times (the half means a teammate joined him in the kill). The next year he led the league in sacks with 20; following the strike-shortened 1982 season, he again led the league in 1983. In 1984 he had 22 sacks, an NFL record. His play brought him a $4-million contract ($725,000 a year plus incentives), with a lifestyle to match.

Possessing frightening speed on a chassis that is Muscle Beach prime, he makes opposing quarterbacks feel as though they are being pursued by a rock slide. In his first season as a starter, in 1980, he mashed opposing quarterbacks 11 1/2 times (the half means a teammate joined him in the kill). The next year he led the league in sacks with 20; following the strike-shortened 1982 season, he again led the league in 1983. In 1984 he had 22 sacks, an NFL record. His play brought him a $4-million contract ($725,000 a year plus incentives), with a lifestyle to match.

So far Corn Products has beaten Penick & Ford in every court, and it hopes that a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court will result in damages sufficient to more than balance the legal expenses incurred to date. Heil! Whether you agree with him or not, George Monroe Moffett, a son of one of the original Standard Oil founders of Corn Products and President of the company since 1931, is worth listening to. He is well informed on the subject of agriculture, for example, because it is part of his job to keep as nearly abreast of Henry ‘’’Tall ace as possible, and because he is a competent and enthusiastic farmer in his own right. Mr. Moffett owns a large stock farm on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and a couple of years ago he decided to spend more time farming, less in Corn’s offices. Over the protests of the other executives, who swore that he was worth just as much to the company in Maryland as he was in New York, he insisted on a heavy salary cut, from $112,500 to $75,000\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/corn-products-fortune-1938/\n\nSource 6:\nmuch more entrepreneurial than managerial.

There are some constructive signs, most visibly in the decisions coming out of a unique yearly meeting—who else but David Rockefeller could possibly need this kind of meeting?—at which the subject and his wife gather with the guardian of his schedule, a Chase vice president named Joseph Reed, and another adviser to plot the allocation of Rockefeller\'s energies over the coming year. The group has been chopping away at Rockefeller\'s outside activities; at one memorable meeting, seven got the ax. (That still leaves him prominently involved with fifteen outside organizations.) Meanwhile, Rockefeller says, he has been focusing more sharply on how he can most efficiently use his time for the benefit of Chase. "I think it\'s a question of recognizing that I do have a finite remaining time at the bank." A case of "better late than never" perhaps, though maybe not soon enough.

Those facts are borne out in documentation provided by those entities upon request, or otherwise publicly available, and were confirmed by campaign spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk.\n\nBut the situation gnawed at him, particularly after his mother and adoptive father divorced.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-is-jd-vance-real-name-origin-john-david-hamel/\n\nSource 5:\nunder license, and for a year it has been carrying on expensive litigation with Penick & Ford, which allegedly infringed the process from 1925 to 1936. So far Corn Products has beaten Penick & Ford in every court, and it hopes that a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court will result in damages sufficient to more than balance the legal expenses incurred to date. Heil! Whether you agree with him or not, George Monroe Moffett, a son of one of the original Standard Oil founders of Corn Products and President of the company since 1931, is worth listening to. He is well informed on the subject of agriculture, for example, because it is part of his job to keep as nearly abreast of Henry ‘’’Tall ace as possible, and because he is a competent and enthusiastic farmer in his own right. Mr. Moffett owns a large stock farm on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and a couple of years ago he decided to spend more time farming, less in Corn’s offices. Over the protests of the other executives, who swore that he was worth just as much to the company in Maryland as he was in New York, he insisted on a heavy salary cut, from $112,500 to $75,000\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/corn-products-fortune-1938/\n\nSource 6:\nmuch more entrepreneurial than managerial. He is not cut out to be a "detail man," even if he had the time. He could plainly, however, use a lot more time for such homely pursuits as thinking—and he has been thinking about that, whenever he can find the time. There are some constructive signs, most visibly in the decisions coming out of a unique yearly meeting—who else but David Rockefeller could possibly need this kind of meeting?—at which the subject and his wife gather with the guardian of his schedule, a Chase vice president named Joseph Reed, and another adviser to plot the allocation of Rockefeller\'s energies over the coming year. The group has been chopping away at Rockefeller\'s outside activities; at one memorable meeting, seven got the ax. (That still leaves him prominently involved with fifteen outside organizations.) Meanwhile, Rockefeller says, he has been focusing more sharply on how he can most efficiently use his time for the benefit of Chase. "I think it\'s a question of recognizing that I do have a finite remaining time at the bank." A case of "better late than never" perhaps, though maybe not soon enough. As things come down to the wire, Rockefeller does have one rather strong—and startling—asset: the emotions among the people who work for him.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/david-rockefeller-death-chase/\n\nSource 7:\nTrump is no different. Is he worth the billions that he says he is? Or is it more like a few hundred million, as several ex-associates say? Outsiders have never gotten to the bottom of his finances, despite his near bankruptcy in the early 1990s, and weeks of digging by Fortune yielded only murk. All his deals are buried in layers of corporate names, partners, and either debt or no debt, depending on whether you\'re talking to Trump. Not that it matters. The more interesting question is not what he owns but how he gets it. And what the heck is it like to work for a man who never turns off? The simple answer to that last question, says Greg Cuneo, chairman of New York construction heavyweight HRH and a man who got his start thanks to Trump, is this: "Bizarre. Totally fucking bizarre." And he means it glowingly.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/donald-trump-business-enterprise/\n\nSource 8:\nfew hundred million, as several ex-associates say?

Ralph gave his occupation as "credit" on his marriage license, and one of Bernie\'s high school classmates, Ed Heiberger, recalls that he "was either a stockbroker or a customer\'s man" (the latter is the equivalent of a client or account representative). Years later he would work for his son Bernie\'s firm. "Ralph looked like a truck driver," adds Joe Kavanau, an old friend of Bernie\'s. "Kind of a rough-and-tumble kind of guy—not the kind of guy you screw with."\n\nSo insistent was Madoff on perfect alignment that, more than once, he dropped his trousers in the office to ensure that the line of his shirt buttons was precisely vertical.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/longform/how-bernie-did-it/\n\nSource 10:\nhas always been a flamboyant person who craved the limelight,\'\' says Kurt Sohn, the Jets shop steward and wide receiver. \'\'And at times it appears he is more concerned with publicity than playing football.\'\' Since Gastineau arrived in the league in 1979, he has not been modest about his abilities, nor has he needed to be. Possessing frightening speed on a chassis that is Muscle Beach prime, he makes opposing quarterbacks feel as though they are being pursued by a rock slide. In his first season as a starter, in 1980, he mashed opposing quarterbacks 11 1/2 times (the half means a teammate joined him in the kill). The next year he led the league in sacks with 20; following the strike-shortened 1982 season, he again led the league in 1983. In 1984 he had 22 sacks, an NFL record. His play brought him a $4-million contract ($725,000 a year plus incentives), with a lifestyle to match. Gastineau models for posters, endorses products, and exhibits the kind of flash once associated with a guy named Broadway Joe Namath. He tooled up to practice one day in a $156,000 Rolls-Royce\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-life-of-a-725000-scab-fortune-classics-1987/'}
