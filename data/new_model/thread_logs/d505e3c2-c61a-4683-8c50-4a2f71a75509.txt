The edgier content actually enhances their appeal to older teens and young 20-somethings.”\n\nThe top domestic opening of all time still firmly belongs to “Avengers: Endgame” with $357.1 million. It’s followed by “Spider-Man: No Way Home” ($260.1 million), “Avengers: Infinity War” ($257.6 million), “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” ($247.9 million) and “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” ($220 million).\n\nSecond place went to Universal\'s “Twisters,” now in its second weekend <https://apnews.com/article/twisters-box-office-316b848fac02b7ea09ae60a1dadffbef> with $35.3 million.

It shattered the opening record for R-rated films previously held by the first “Deadpool” ($132 million) and notched a spot in the top 10 openings of all time.\n\nIncluding international showings, where it’s racked up an addition $233.3 million from 52 markets, “Deadpool & Wolverine” is looking at a global opening of over $438.3 million.\nFittingly for both characters’ introduction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, “Deadpool & Wolverine” played less like earlier X-Men or Deadpool movies and more like an Avengers pic. In the top domestic opening weekends ever, “Deadpool & Wolverine” is seated in 8th place between “The Avengers” ($207.4 million) and “Black Panther" ($202 million), bumping “Avengers: Age of Ultron” ($191.3 million) out of the top 10.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/28/disney-deadpool-and-wolverine-r-rated-box-office-record-marvel/\n\nSource 3:\nThe cumulative summer box office clocked in at over $3.6 billion domestically <https://fortune.com/2024/08/18/disney-films-42-percent-summer-box-office-aliens-deadpool-wolverine/> – a dip of 10% from 2023’s $4 billion season that could likely be attributed to the “Barbenheimer” <https://apnews.com/article/barbie-oppenheimer-barbenheimer-box-office-3ff25c0a3acf7b568866c2ff307d0108> box office craze that drew crowds en masse to see “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” last summer.\n\nThe close of the season brought what Dergarabedian described as a “stranglehold” of familiar summer hits on box office rankings, with “Alien: Romulus” and “It Ends With Us” rounding out the top three for the second weekend in a row. Six of the top 10 films of the weekend had been playing for three or more weeks.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/02/deadpool-wolverine-box-office-reagan-tops-expectations-labor-day-weekend/\n\nSource 3:\nJust like in the movies, Deadpool can’t be killed.\n\n“Deadpool & Wolverine,” <https://apnews.com/article/deadpool-wolverine-movie-review-1bab66540fcd5fb65f8d6bed58a5d48c> one of the defining movies of the summer, ruled the box office on a weekend with quiet openings and low theater attendance as the summer movie season came to an anticlimactic close.\n\nFor the second weekend in a row, “Deadpool & Wolverine,” Marvel’s smash hit that has shattered records and become the best-selling R-rated movie of all time, topped the charts, with other holdovers from the summer following behind. After six weeks in theaters, the film made $15.2 million domestically Friday through Sunday, and it’s expected to cross the domestic $600 million mark following Monday’s Labor Day holiday. The Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman superhero flick will be one of only 16 titles to hit that milestone.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/02/deadpool-wolverine-box-office-reagan-tops-expectations-labor-day-weekend/\n\nSource 4:\n“Alien: Romulus" <https://apnews.com/article/alien-romulus-cailee-spaeny-fede-alvarez-interview-b10f5ef76b6899c8f416ce8cbd2b01b2> and “It Ends With Us,” <https://apnews.com/article/it-ends-with-us-movie-review-blake-lively-035aa1becea86aa90a5f1aa982cf823c> two more holdovers from the summer, came in fourth and fifth place, respectively. The sci-fi horror film brought in $3.9 million and the romance drama brought in $3.8 million.\n\nThe only other new release of the weekend to make it on the box office rankings was “The Greatest of All Time,” an Indian Tamil-language science fiction action film. The movie stars Joseph Vijay and was directed by Venkat Prabhu, who is known for directing and writing other Indian action films.
