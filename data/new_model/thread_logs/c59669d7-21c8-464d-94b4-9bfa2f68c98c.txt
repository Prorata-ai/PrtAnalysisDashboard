A psychiatrist, who runs a virtual mental health practice in Maryland, saw his business hobbled as some of his virtual assistants and therapists couldn\'t either make phone calls or log on to their computers.

But many computers are expected to need hands-on work that could take days, if not longer, to complete.\n\nFor many small businesses that are impacted, that could mean working around the clock this weekend to make sure their systems are up and running, said Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.\n\n“Small businesses rely on third parties for this not to happen and instead, it became a ‘code red’ situation,” Ives said.\n\nOverall, Ives noted tech problems can be easier to fix for big companies that have a sizable number of experts on their payroll as opposed to small businesses who could face more of an “uphill battle” because they have fewer technical resources.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/22/crowdstrike-global-outage-small-businesses/\n\nSource 5:\nPast disruptions have been less severe.

Shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products and agricultural goods would be hit hard, he said, especially with harvest season looming.\n\nBoth railroads have extensive networks in the U.S., and CPKC also serves Mexico. Those operations will keep running even if there is a work stoppage.\n\nCPKC said it remains committed to avoiding a work stoppage that would damage Canada\'s economy and international reputation. “However we must take responsible and prudent steps to prepare for a potential rail service interruption next week,” spokesman Patrick Waldron said in a statement.\n\nShutting down the network will allow the railroad to get dangerous goods off of its network before any stoppage, CPKC said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/17/us-supply-chains-canada-railroad-networks-shutdown-networks-labor-union-dispute/\n\nSource 9:\n"BTK’s job isn’t to cut off the internet but to get it working faster," said IT professor Cem Say, noting that Turkey ranked "111th in the world for internet speed".\n\nThis is not the first time that Turkish authorities have temporarily blocked access to social media sites, notably following attacks.\n\nWikipedia was blocked between April 2017 and January 2020 over two articles that alleged a link between the presidency and extremism.\n\nAlthough Erdogan\'s government is regularly accused of muzzling freedom of expression, the move to stop Wikipedia caused shock because of the huge amount of online information that became inaccessible.\n\nIn April, Facebook owner Meta suspended its Threads social network in Turkey following a decision by authorities there to prevent it from sharing information with Instagram.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/02/instagram-blocked-by-turkish-government-over-its-censorship-of-eulogies-for-killed-hamas-leader/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/02/instagram-blocked-by-turkish-government-over-its-censorship-of-eulogies-for-killed-hamas-leader/\n\nSource 10:\n“Our teams will be working actively through the weekend as we continue to resolve remaining issues in preparation for the start of the work week,” the hospital wrote in a statement <https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/windows-outage-update/>.\n\nIn Austria, a leading organization of doctors said the outage exposed the vulnerability of relying on digital systems. Harald Mayer, vice president of the Austrian Chamber of Doctors, said the outage showed that hospitals need analog backups to protect patient care.\n\nThe organization also called on governments to impose high standards in patient data protection and security, and on health providers to train staff and put systems in place to manage crises.\n\n“Happily, where there were problems, these were kept small and short-lived and many areas of care were unaffected” in Austria, Mayer said.\n\nThe Schleswig-Holstein University Hospital in northern Germany, which canceled all elective procedures Friday, said Saturday that systems were gradually being restored and that elective surgery could resume by Monday.\n\nWill the tech industry face a reckoning?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/20/crowdstrike-outage-phishing-attempts-scam-artists-microsoft-windows-cybersecurity/\n\nSource 11:\nIt\'s not unusual for an online journalist to see their old work disappear.

According to [3], flights in airports across the world would be grounded, leading to widespread cancellations and delays. This is because many airlines rely on the internet to operate their systems, and without it, they would be unable to function. Additionally, hospitals like Mass General Brigham [3] would have to cancel non-urgent visits, and television channels like Sky News [3] would be unable to broadcast.

The impact on businesses would also be substantial. Small businesses, in particular, would struggle to cope with the loss of internet connectivity. As noted in [4], an owner of a consumer insights research firm wouldn't be able to pay her employees, make deadlines, or send key research to clients. A psychiatrist who runs a virtual mental health practice would see his business hobbled, and a restaurant owner would worry about paying vendors and workers. The outage would highlight the fragility of a digitized world dependent on a few providers for key computing services [4].

According to [3], flights in airports across the world would be grounded, leading to widespread cancellations and delays. This is because many airlines rely on the internet to operate their systems, and without it, they would be unable to function. Additionally, hospitals like Mass General Brigham [3] would have to cancel non-urgent visits, and television channels like Sky News [3] would be unable to broadcast.

The impact on businesses would also be substantial. Small businesses, in particular, would struggle to cope with the loss of internet connectivity. As noted in [4], an owner of a consumer insights research firm wouldn't be able to pay her employees, make deadlines, or send key research to clients. A psychiatrist who runs a virtual mental health practice would see his business hobbled, and a restaurant owner would worry about paying vendors and workers. The outage would highlight the fragility of a digitized world dependent on a few providers for key computing services [4].

According to [3], flights in airports across the world would be grounded, leading to widespread cancellations and delays. This is because many airlines rely on the internet to operate their systems, and without it, they would be unable to function. Additionally, hospitals like Mass General Brigham [3] would have to cancel non-urgent visits, and television channels like Sky News [3] would be unable to broadcast.

The impact on businesses would also be substantial. Small businesses, in particular, would struggle to cope with the loss of internet connectivity. As noted in [4], an owner of a consumer insights research firm wouldn't be able to pay her employees, make deadlines, or send key research to clients. A psychiatrist who runs a virtual mental health practice would see his business hobbled, and a restaurant owner would worry about paying vendors and workers.

Additionally, hospitals like Mass General Brigham [3] would have to cancel non-urgent visits, and television channels like Sky News [3] would be unable to broadcast.

The impact on businesses would also be substantial. Small businesses, in particular, would struggle to cope with the loss of internet connectivity. As noted in [4], an owner of a consumer insights research firm wouldn't be able to pay her employees, make deadlines, or send key research to clients. A psychiatrist who runs a virtual mental health practice would see his business hobbled, and a restaurant owner would worry about paying vendors and workers. The outage would highlight the fragility of a digitized world dependent on a few providers for key computing services [4].

The effects of an internet shutdown would be felt across various industries, including finance, transportation, and healthcare. As stated in [7], banks in South Africa experienced service disruptions, and customers were unable to make payments or use ATMs. Airlink, a regional airline, reported that its IT network and telephone lines were down due to the global network outage [7]. The shutdown would also have a significant impact on supply chains, with railroads handling about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion [8]. Overall, a day without the internet would be a major disruption to modern life, and its consequences would be felt across the globe.
