Fellows do not apply and are never officially informed that they’ve been nominated unless they are selected for the award.\n\nThe interdisciplinary award seeks to “enable” people with a track record and the potential to produce additional extraordinary work, said Marlies Carruth, director of the MacArthur Fellows Program.\n\nThe 2024 fellows are:\n\nLoka Ashwood, 39, Lexington, Kentucky, a sociologist at the University of Kentucky who studies how environmental issues, corporations and state policy intersect to harm rural communities and reduce their trust in democracy.\n\nRuha Benjamin, 46, Princeton, New Jersey, a transdisciplinary scholar and writer at Princeton University who studies how new technologies and medical research often reinforce social and racial inequality and bias.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.6061348), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='53fcb280-3791-4fa4-a0a6-a4fe508c6043', embedding=None, metadata={'id': '3c93434e13785fb9c698cfd2cbfddfd11051082751380e2bab5886e5b08af6d1-1', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': '3c93434e13785fb9c698cfd2cbfddfd11051082751380e2bab5886e5b08af6d1', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20240807, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-07', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1708443293-e1723020470720.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2024, 'date_month': 8, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/asia/2024/08/07/nobel-laureate-microfinance-pioneer-muhaamad-yunus-interim-leader-bangladesh-protest-crisis/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 7, 'title': 'A Nobel laureate and microfinance pioneer steps in to lead Bangladesh out of a deadly protest crisis', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/asia/2024/08/07/nobel-laureate-microfinance-pioneer-muhaamad-yunus-interim-leader-bangladesh-protest-crisis/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='From facing jail time to leading the country\n\nIt’s a remarkable turn of events for Yunus, who was facing a jail sentence <https://fortune.com/asia/2024/01/03/nobel-winner-muhammad-yunus-six-month-jail-term-bangladesh-election-sheikh-hasina/> earlier this year. \n\nIn January, a judge in Dhaka convicted Yunus and three other executives at Grameen Telecom for several labor law violations, including failing to create a welfare fund for employees, and he was sentenced to six months in jail. \n\nYet observers believed the case to be politically motivated.

Hassabis is the CEO of Google’s DeepMind <https://fortune.com/company/deepmind/> AI unit, while Jumper is a director there.\n\nThe pair received the award for their work on the AlphaFold 2 AI model, which in 2020 stunned the scientific world <https://fortune.com/2020/11/30/deepmind-solved-protein-folding-alphafold/> with its ability to correctly predict the structure of almost all known proteins from their DNA sequences. Previously, computer software was much less accurate at predicting protein structures, while imaging methods to discover the shape of proteins were time-consuming and costly.\n\nThis breakthrough was hugely impactful since proteins are the engines behind most biological processes, with their shape determining their function. Among other things, being able to predict the shape of a protein unlocks better understanding of disease and could enable researchers to more quickly develop new drugs.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/google-deepmind-leaders-hassabis-and-jumper-win-nobel-prize-for-chemistry/\n\nSource 6:\nFor the first time, a Nobel Prize has been awarded to pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nGeoffrey Hinton and John Hopfield were on Tuesday granted the honor of becoming Nobel laureates in physics, for their work on artificial neural networks over the last four decades. They will share the award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.06 million) that comes with the prize.\nHinton, 76, is by far the better-known of the two. Sometimes referred to as one of the “godfathers of AI” —along with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun—Hinton dramatically quit Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> last year, publicly <https://fortune.com/2023/05/08/godfather-artificial-intelligence-geoffrey-hinton-climate-change/> warning <https://fortune.com/2023/05/02/godfather-ai-geoff-hinton-google-warns-artificial-intelligence-nightmare-scenario/> of the near- and long-term risks <https://fortune.com/europe/2023/10/10/rogue-artificial-intelligence-manipulate-people-british-godfather-ai-geoffrey-hinton/> of the technology he had helped to create.

While Hinton is celebrated for his pioneering work in AI and popularizing backpropagation, critics, including AI expert Jürgen Schmidhuber, argue that the prize overlooks the foundational contributions of Paul Werbos <https://syncedreview.com/2020/04/23/who-invented-backpropagation-hinton-says-he-didnt-but-his-work-made-it-popular/> and Shun-Ichi Amari—two figures whose groundbreaking work decades earlier laid the groundwork for modern neural networks.

The central bank established it in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish businessman and chemist who invented dynamite and established the five Nobel Prizes.\n\nThough Nobel purists stress that the economics prize is technically not a Nobel Prize, it is always presented together with the others on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel\'s death in 1896.\n\nNobel honors were announced last week in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/14/nobel-economics-prize-daron-acemoglu-simon-johnson-james-a-robinson/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/14/nobel-economics-prize-daron-acemoglu-simon-johnson-james-a-robinson/\n\nSource 3:\nSterlin Harjo, 44, Tulsa, Oklahoma, a filmmaker whose work, including the television series “Reservation Dogs” that he co-created, is grounded in the daily lives of Native American communities.\n\nJuan Felipe Herrera, 75, Fresno, California, a poet, educator and writer dedicated to expressing the shared experiences of the Mexican-American community through often bilingual work that crosses genres and draws on both contemporary events and the cultures of pre-colonial societies.\n\nLing Ma, 41, Chicago, a fiction writer whose often surreal or speculative stories build from and shed light on contemporary experiences of alienation, immigration and materialism.\n\nJennifer L. Morgan, 58, New York, a historian at New York University whose work focuses on enslaved African women, revealing how the wealth of slaveowners and the growth of the economy was built on their exploitation and reproductive labor.\n\nMartha Muñoz, 39, New Haven, Connecticut, an evolutionary biologist at Yale University whose research investigates what factors drive the rates and patterns of evolution.\n\nShaikaja Paik, 50, Cincinnati, a historian of modern India at the University of Cincinnati whose work explores caste discrimination and its intersection with gender and sexuality in the lives of Dalit women.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/01/2024-macarthur-genius-grant-recipients/\n\nSource 3:\nThe John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation announced Tuesday its 2024 class of fellows, often known as recipients of the “genius grant."\n\nThe 22 fellows will each receive a grant of $800,000 over five years to spend however they want. They were selected from nominations in a yearslong process that solicits input from their communities and peers. Fellows do not apply and are never officially informed that they’ve been nominated unless they are selected for the award.\n\nThe interdisciplinary award seeks to “enable” people with a track record and the potential to produce additional extraordinary work, said Marlies Carruth, director of the MacArthur Fellows Program.\n\nThe 2024 fellows are:\n\nLoka Ashwood, 39, Lexington, Kentucky, a sociologist at the University of Kentucky who studies how environmental issues, corporations and state policy intersect to harm rural communities and reduce their trust in democracy.\n\nRuha Benjamin, 46, Princeton, New Jersey, a transdisciplinary scholar and writer at Princeton University who studies how new technologies and medical research often reinforce social and racial inequality and bias.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/01/2024-macarthur-genius-grant-recipients/\n\nSource 4:\nFrom facing jail time to leading the country\n\nIt’s a remarkable turn of events for Yunus, who was facing a jail sentence <https://fortune.com/asia/2024/01/03/nobel-winner-muhammad-yunus-six-month-jail-term-bangladesh-election-sheikh-hasina/> earlier this year. \n\nIn January, a judge in Dhaka convicted Yunus and three other executives at Grameen Telecom for several labor law violations, including failing to create a welfare fund for employees, and he was sentenced to six months in jail. \n\nYet observers believed the case to be politically motivated. Yunus was considered a rival to Hasina, and had briefly flirted with the idea of setting up a rival political party. World leaders like former U.S. president Barack Obama and former UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon called on Bangladesh to suspend <https://apnews.com/article/hasina-yunus-nobel-letter-bangladesh-4b7ee08200cda7fddd6caa364e61274e> the legal proceedings, to no avail.\n\nAt the time, Yunus said the verdict was “contrary to all legal precedent and logic.”\n\nA microfinance pioneer\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/08/07/nobel-laureate-microfinance-pioneer-muhaamad-yunus-interim-leader-bangladesh-protest-crisis/\n\nSource 5:\nIt’s clearly a big year for AI at the most prestigious scientific awards. The Nobel Prize for Physics was on Tuesday given to Geoffrey Hinton and John Hopfield <https://fortune.com/2024/10/08/ai-pioneers-geoffrey-hinton-and-john-hopfield-win-nobel-prize-for-physics/> for their work in the development of artificial neural networks—the foundation of today’s AI systems, including AlphaFold 2.\n\nHinton was also a leading figure in Google’s AI efforts as part of its Brain unit (which developed the transformer deep-learning technology that enables today’s generative AI). Shortly after Google merged the Brain unit with DeepMind in April last year, Hinton quit so he could warn the world of AI’s risks <https://fortune.com/2023/05/02/godfather-ai-geoff-hinton-google-warns-artificial-intelligence-nightmare-scenario/>.\n\nHinton and Jumper’s award was controversial among some physicists, who saw the links between their field and AI as tenuous. The framing of Wednesday’s chemistry Nobel is far clearer, rewarding the development of a specific AI tool that is rapidly transforming biological research.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/google-deepmind-leaders-hassabis-and-jumper-win-nobel-prize-for-chemistry/\n\nSource 5:\nGoogle <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> suddenly finds itself with two Nobel laureates on its staff.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that Demis Hassabis and John Jumper are recipients of this year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Hassabis is the CEO of Google’s DeepMind <https://fortune.com/company/deepmind/> AI unit, while Jumper is a director there.\n\nThe pair received the award for their work on the AlphaFold 2 AI model, which in 2020 stunned the scientific world <https://fortune.com/2020/11/30/deepmind-solved-protein-folding-alphafold/> with its ability to correctly predict the structure of almost all known proteins from their DNA sequences. Previously, computer software was much less accurate at predicting protein structures, while imaging methods to discover the shape of proteins were time-consuming and costly.\n\nThis breakthrough was hugely impactful since proteins are the engines behind most biological processes, with their shape determining their function. Among other things, being able to predict the shape of a protein unlocks better understanding of disease and could enable researchers to more quickly develop new drugs.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/google-deepmind-leaders-hassabis-and-jumper-win-nobel-prize-for-chemistry/\n\nSource 6:\nFor the first time, a Nobel Prize has been awarded to pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nGeoffrey Hinton and John Hopfield were on Tuesday granted the honor of becoming Nobel laureates in physics, for their work on artificial neural networks over the last four decades. They will share the award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.06 million) that comes with the prize.\nHinton, 76, is by far the better-known of the two. Sometimes referred to as one of the “godfathers of AI” —along with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun—Hinton dramatically quit Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> last year, publicly <https://fortune.com/2023/05/08/godfather-artificial-intelligence-geoffrey-hinton-climate-change/> warning <https://fortune.com/2023/05/02/godfather-ai-geoff-hinton-google-warns-artificial-intelligence-nightmare-scenario/> of the near- and long-term risks <https://fortune.com/europe/2023/10/10/rogue-artificial-intelligence-manipulate-people-british-godfather-ai-geoffrey-hinton/> of the technology he had helped to create. He said he regretted his life’s work <https://fortune.com/2023/05/01/godfather-ai-geoffrey-hinton-quit-google-regrets-lifes-work-bad-actors/>, as AI is too easily misused; he believes it could increase inequality and perhaps even end up subjugating humanity.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/08/ai-pioneers-geoffrey-hinton-and-john-hopfield-win-nobel-prize-for-physics/\n\nSource 7:\nAbout the system\n\nWhile Sunak can put forward nominees for the honors list, the appointments will still have to be approved by King Charles III.\n\nNominations filter through a series of independent committees within the honors system infrastructure <https://www.royal.uk/knighthoods-and-damehoods>. \n\nAnyone can be put forward by a member of the public for an award, though a "steer" is given by the prime minister about the direction the list takes.\n\nIn 2023, Sunak set out what he would like to see the system focus on, which included "entrepreneurs and innovators who create thriving businesses and deliver growth across the country." \n\nFocus was also put on philanthropy, education, crime reduction, and health care.\n\nWhile the prime minister and sovereign have a seminal role in the process, there are also a series of subcommittees <https://honours.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/about/governance/#primeminister> tasked with oversight in various categories.\n\nThese bodies are split into a main committee, as well as 10 groups focused on everything from services to the arts, to the economy to parliamentary and public work.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/06/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-knighthood-rishi-sunak/\n\nSource 8:\nThe recent Nobel Prize awarded to Geoffrey Hinton for his contributions to artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked controversy <https://x.com/SchmidhuberAI/status/1844022724328394780>, exposing a deeper issue in how society rewards innovation. While Hinton is celebrated for his pioneering work in AI and popularizing backpropagation, critics, including AI expert Jürgen Schmidhuber, argue that the prize overlooks the foundational contributions of Paul Werbos <https://syncedreview.com/2020/04/23/who-invented-backpropagation-hinton-says-he-didnt-but-his-work-made-it-popular/> and Shun-Ichi Amari—two figures whose groundbreaking work decades earlier laid the groundwork for modern neural networks. Werbos’s 1974 PhD thesis <https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Roots+of+Backpropagation%3A+From+Ordered+Derivatives+to+Neural+Networks+and+Political+Forecasting+-p-9780471598978> and Amari’s 1972 adaptive learning model\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/controversy-ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-nobel-prize-tech/\n\nSource 9:\nThis isn’t the first time Nobel Prize winners have weighed in on the 2024 presidential election. Joseph Stiglitz, who won the award in 2001, led this petition as well as another one published in June <https://www.axios.com/2024/06/25/nobel-prize-winners-biden-economy-trump-inflation>. \n\nThe last letter, signed by 16 economists, warned of potential reignited inflation under Trump. Since then, candidates have changed on the Democratic side, more information has been collated by both parties, and more economists have won Nobels, making the list of Harris supporters longer. \n\nTwo of the three <https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/business/nobel-prize-economics-acemoglu-johnson-robinson/index.html#:~:text=Three%20economists%20were%20awarded%20the,Swedish%20kronor%20(%241%20million)> most recent scholars to be awarded the Nobel Prize joined the cause this time around.\n\nWhy it matters\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/24/nobel-prize-winners-kamala-harris-economists-endorsement/'}
