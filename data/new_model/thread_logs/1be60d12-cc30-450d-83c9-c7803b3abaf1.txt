In the seven years between 1910 and the entry of the U.S. into the War, the government four times had a Treasury deficit. These deficits were relatively small, but the prosecution of the War shot expenditures up until they were nearly four times as large as Treasury receipts in 1918 and again nearly four times as large in 1919. The $18,500,000,000 that the Treasury poured out that year makes even the $7,000,000,000 of ordinary and extraordinary expenditures in 1934 seem small by comparison. The strain was terrific, but nobody bothered about it, for the courage and purpose to bear it--"Give till it hurts"--was everywhere manifest. Certainly a balanced budget is a pleasant thing. Certainly it is a desirable thing. But there are those who, not without reason, question whether it is an essential thing, except over a long period of time-perhaps ten years, perhaps the duration of the business cycle.

Humans write learning algorithms that give the machine an objective—try to come up with labels for these pictures (“cat” “dog”) that match the ones that humans give them—and some mathematical dials and switches to fiddle with to get to the solution.

Huston at least got a bang out of associating with ballplayers and sports writers, but Ruppert more or less held himself socially aloof from the Broadwayish baseball crowd. The Colonel was never a very knowing fan. His passions were involved in the sport only to the extent that he wanted his team to win consistently and by very large scores. (It is reported by a sports writer, Frank Graham, that Ruppert once admonished pitcher Waite Hoyt: "You win all your games by scores of 1 to 0 and 2 to 1. Our other pitchers win their games by 9 and 10 to 1. Why don\'t you win some of your games like that?") In 1915 the Yankees finished fifth; in 1916, fourth; 1917, sixth; 1918, fourth. The Colonel was not seen at the games very often.

In the seven years between 1910 and the entry of the U.S. into the War, the government four times had a Treasury deficit. These deficits were relatively small, but the prosecution of the War shot expenditures up until they were nearly four times as large as Treasury receipts in 1918 and again nearly four times as large in 1919. The $18,500,000,000 that the Treasury poured out that year makes even the $7,000,000,000 of ordinary and extraordinary expenditures in 1934 seem small by comparison. The strain was terrific, but nobody bothered about it, for the courage and purpose to bear it--"Give till it hurts"--was everywhere manifest. Certainly a balanced budget is a pleasant thing. Certainly it is a desirable thing.

The Cabots and the Lowells and their likes and peers have, it may be alleged, ceased to be the Cabots and the Lowells. But they have ceased only by becoming more so. And the key to the present status of Boston lies in that apparent contradiction. --- There is first of all the matter of personal talent. So far as personal talent is concerned there can be no doubt but that the hopeful fears of the rest of the country have been disappointed.

U.S. Horse Population 1900: 21 million 1998: 5 million The other truly transforming business invention of the first quarter of the century, besides the car, was the airplane--another industry whose plainly brilliant future would have caused investors to salivate. So I went back to check out aircraft manufacturers and found that in the 1919-39 period, there were about 300 companies, only a handful still breathing today. Among the planes made then--we must have been the Silicon Valley of that age--were both the Nebraska and the Omaha, two aircraft that even the most loyal Nebraskan no longer relies upon. Move on to failures of airlines. Here\'s a list of 129 airlines that in the past 20 years filed for bankruptcy. Continental was smart enough to make that list twice. As of 1992, in fact--though the picture would have improved since then--the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country\'s airline companies was zero. Absolutely zero.

In the seven years between 1910 and the entry of the U.S. into the War, the government four times had a Treasury deficit. These deficits were relatively small, but the prosecution of the War shot expenditures up until they were nearly four times as large as Treasury receipts in 1918 and again nearly four times as large in 1919. The $18,500,000,000 that the Treasury poured out that year makes even the $7,000,000,000 of ordinary and extraordinary expenditures in 1934 seem small by comparison. The strain was terrific, but nobody bothered about it, for the courage and purpose to bear it--"Give till it hurts"--was everywhere manifest. Certainly a balanced budget is a pleasant thing. Certainly it is a desirable thing. But there are those who, not without reason, question whether it is an essential thing, except over a long period of time-perhaps ten years, perhaps the duration of the business cycle. Their more conservative brethren answer that this is all very well but that it is impossible to plan intelligently for as long a period as ten years or as indefinite a period as a business cycle.

It already is by our criteria, with the relevant question being whether these conditions will continue, not whether they will materialize. \n\n"The odds continue to rise for this bull-case scenario, with many recent developments on the demand side, supply side, and monetary policy all supportive."\n\nInvestors are increasingly coming around to a soft-landing consensus, he added.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/01/economy-roaring-20s-ubs-growth-unemployment-inflation/\n\nSource 3:\nThe Sahm Rule <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME>—which in the past has been accurate in predicting when an economy will enter a recession—was triggered back in July. \n\nThe Sahm Rule looks at two factors: the current three-month moving average of U.S. unemployment and the lowest three-month moving average of U.S. unemployment over the past year.\n\nIf the current average is higher than the lowest average by more than half a percentage point, the American economy is headed for a recession. Its latest reading for August sits at 0.57 pp.\n\nDraho admits that the labor market could prove to be the snag in America\'s return to an economic heyday, writing: "Cooling over the past six months has done more than just rebalance the labor market, it has left it looser than it was pre-pandemic."\n\n"The U.S. election and the escalating war in the Middle East are also sources of potential risks," adds Draho.\n\nOf course, the original Roaring ’20s had their end as well.

Our other pitchers win their games by 9 and 10 to 1. Why don\'t you win some of your games like that?") In 1915 the Yankees finished fifth; in 1916, fourth; 1917, sixth; 1918, fourth. The Colonel was not seen at the games very often. Throughout this period the Yankees were paying top prices to other American League clubs for such players as their rivals were willing to sell, but the New York team never rose above mediocrity. It was only by a most fortuitous circumstance, in 1919, that the Yankees pulled out of this funk.

Their sons went into planting, ranching, shipping, shopkeeping, factoring, and banking; and by tenacious illustration of the Parable of the Talents they soon controlled more of Hawaii than the natives themselves. In 1893, anxious to become part of the U.S. and thereby get the benefit of sugar bounties, the sons of the missionaries staged a revolution against Queen Liliuokalani with the help of a complaisant U.S. Minister and a detachment of U.S. marines. President Cleveland refused to accept a bid for annexation of this new island Texas; but the annexation came five years later. Even before the revolution of 1893 the U.S. had been forehanded enough to get unrestricted naval rights to the anchorage of Pearl Harbor. To certain visitors from the U.S. mainland, the life of the missionaries\' sons may have a nostalgic quality.

And copies of the forged Protocols of the Elders of Zion were passing solemnly and secretly from hand to hand. But a few years later the New York World\'s exposure of the racket behind the Klan had had its effect, the Coolidge boom had given the paraders something else to think about, Henry Ford had apologized and retracted, and the Protocols were on their way to the judicial examination which eventually stripped them to the fraudulent skin. From that collapse not even the depression, traditional ally of all phobias, was able to save the cause. Anti-Semitism languished and still languishes. The great shift from sheets to shirts has failed to save it. Although an estimated half million people may attend occasional anti-Semitic meetings, etc., there are probably no more than 15,000 loyal Jew-hating group members in the whole United States and many of these are loyal only in a negative and receptive manner.

That’s what machine learning is: Instead of a human programmer writing all the lines of code, the machine does it. Humans write learning algorithms that give the machine an objective—try to come up with labels for these pictures (“cat” “dog”) that match the ones that humans give them—and some mathematical dials and switches to fiddle with to get to the solution. But then the machine does the rest. This type of autonomy already generates a bunch of issues, which we’ve grappled with in AI since the start: Since the machine wrote the software, and it’s pretty darn complicated, it’s not easy for humans to unpack what it’s doing. That can make it hard to predict or understand or fix.

In the seven years between 1910 and the entry of the U.S. into the War, the government four times had a Treasury deficit. These deficits were relatively small, but the prosecution of the War shot expenditures up until they were nearly four times as large as Treasury receipts in 1918 and again nearly four times as large in 1919. The $18,500,000,000 that the Treasury poured out that year makes even the $7,000,000,000 of ordinary and extraordinary expenditures in 1934 seem small by comparison. The strain was terrific, but nobody bothered about it, for the courage and purpose to bear it--"Give till it hurts"--was everywhere manifest. Certainly a balanced budget is a pleasant thing. Certainly it is a desirable thing. But there are those who, not without reason, question whether it is an essential thing, except over a long period of time-perhaps ten years, perhaps the duration of the business cycle.

In the seven years between 1910 and the entry of the U.S. into the War, the government four times had a Treasury deficit. These deficits were relatively small, but the prosecution of the War shot expenditures up until they were nearly four times as large as Treasury receipts in 1918 and again nearly four times as large in 1919. The $18,500,000,000 that the Treasury poured out that year makes even the $7,000,000,000 of ordinary and extraordinary expenditures in 1934 seem small by comparison. The strain was terrific, but nobody bothered about it, for the courage and purpose to bear it--"Give till it hurts"--was everywhere manifest. Certainly a balanced budget is a pleasant thing. Certainly it is a desirable thing. But there are those who, not without reason, question whether it is an essential thing, except over a long period of time-perhaps ten years, perhaps the duration of the business cycle. Their more conservative brethren answer that this is all very well but that it is impossible to plan intelligently for as long a period as ten years or as indefinite a period as a business cycle.

The Colonel was never a very knowing fan. His passions were involved in the sport only to the extent that he wanted his team to win consistently and by very large scores. (It is reported by a sports writer, Frank Graham, that Ruppert once admonished pitcher Waite Hoyt: "You win all your games by scores of 1 to 0 and 2 to 1. Our other pitchers win their games by 9 and 10 to 1. Why don\'t you win some of your games like that?") In 1915 the Yankees finished fifth; in 1916, fourth; 1917, sixth; 1918, fourth. The Colonel was not seen at the games very often. Throughout this period the Yankees were paying top prices to other American League clubs for such players as their rivals were willing to sell, but the New York team never rose above mediocrity.

In 1893, anxious to become part of the U.S. and thereby get the benefit of sugar bounties, the sons of the missionaries staged a revolution against Queen Liliuokalani with the help of a complaisant U.S. Minister and a detachment of U.S. marines. President Cleveland refused to accept a bid for annexation of this new island Texas; but the annexation came five years later. Even before the revolution of 1893 the U.S. had been forehanded enough to get unrestricted naval rights to the anchorage of Pearl Harbor.

Humans write learning algorithms that give the machine an objective—try to come up with labels for these pictures (“cat” “dog”) that match the ones that humans give them—and some mathematical dials and switches to fiddle with to get to the solution. But then the machine does the rest. This type of autonomy already generates a bunch of issues, which we’ve grappled with in AI since the start: Since the machine wrote the software, and it’s pretty darn complicated, it’s not easy for humans to unpack what it’s doing.
