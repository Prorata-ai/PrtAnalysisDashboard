Scientists at NASA are hoping to find out.\n\nEuropa is the fourth-largest of Jupiter’s moons and has a saltwater ocean under its ice shell that has twice the amount of water contained in Earth’s oceans. Officials say that might mean it has the chemical elements necessary for life.\n\nThe Europa Clipper will explore that moon from above, looking for places below the planet’s surface that could support life. The spacecraft is set to lift off Monday at 12:06 p.m. ET. (The mission was originally scheduled for liftoff on Oct. 10, but was delayed due to the approach of Hurricane Milton.)\n\nThe Clipper\'s instruments will perform a comprehensive survey of the planet, from its core and its 10- to 15-mile-thick ice shell to the oceans and thin atmosphere. Planning for the mission began in 2013, but was slow to become reality as NASA struggled to create a spacecraft that could withstand the radiation emanating from Jupiter (which is 20,000 times that found on Earth).\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/14/nasa-launch-europa-clipper-mission-jupiter-moon-suitable-life/\n\nSource 1:\nThe spacecraft, the largest NASA <https://fortune.com/2017/11/07/jupiter-nasa-photos-juno/> has ever built for a planetary mission, will travel 1.8 million miles to reach Jupiter in April of 2030. It will conduct 49 close flybys of Europa and orbit Jupiter. Flybys will take place every two or three weeks and will bring Clipper within 16 miles of the surface.\n\nWhile the stated mission of the orbiter is to “determine if Europa has conditions suitable to support life,” scientists aren’t looking for existing life on the moon. They’re more interested to learn more about the composition of the ocean and what is behind plumes that have been seen shooting up through the ice. \n\nAnd, of course, they want to know whether it’s habitable, as NASA says “abundant liquid water, energy, and the right chemical elements make Europa one of the best places in the solar system to seek present-day life beyond Earth.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/14/nasa-launch-europa-clipper-mission-jupiter-moon-suitable-life/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/14/nasa-launch-europa-clipper-mission-jupiter-moon-suitable-life/\n\nSource 2:\nThat is, of course, the other matter of constant interest: Just how solidly is the board behind Fiorina? A few weeks ago, one secondhand but relatively credible report reached Fortune that the board is split over Fiorina. The two outside directors that we managed to talk to, though, Babbio and Knowling, firmly denied that was so. We did not get calls back from director Richard Hackborn, a strong-minded, retired HP executive who built the printer business. Hackborn played a key role in hiring Fiorina in 1999, and she is thought to need his continued support. Without it, her job might be imperiled. But don\'t forget that this board made this merger and has its own pride on the line.\n\nWhich way forward?\n\nWhich brings us to part two of our inquiry: assessing the future of Hewlett-Packard. As director Knowling says, "We\'re off the diving board." Okay, given that the merger is history, can this company compete from here on in?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/why-carlys-big-bet-is-failing-fortune-classics-2005/\n\nSource 2:\nSee also: HP Plummets 20% to Six-Year Low <http://money.cnn.com/2011/08/19/technology/hp_stock/index.htm>\n\nIn any case, it is the non-GAAP profits that Wall Street analysts run with, dwelling almost always on the twists and turns of today. In 2004 these included a thudding earnings miss for HP in its third fiscal quarter and a rousing bounceback in the fourth. In the minds of analysts hangs also the everlasting possibility that the "execution" Fiorina is promising might actually produce a long string of consistent quarters in which printers continue to shine and all the computer businesses suddenly wake up and do well.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/why-carlys-big-bet-is-failing-fortune-classics-2005/\n\nSource 2:\nBut celebrity, as everybody knows, isn\'t an achievement in itself. Beneath the public image are the yardsticks against which executives are — and should be — measured. So it is right to ask whether this whirlwind has succeeded. And inevitably that question must be answered in two parts. First, under the only lens that matters, did the famed merger that Fiorina engineered between HP <https://fortune.com/company/hp/> and Compaq produce value for HP\'s shareholders? Second, with that merger nearly three years past, is HP in shape to thrive in its brutally competitive world?\nThe answers are no and doubtful.\n\nThe merger\n\nLet\'s begin with that deeply controversial HP/Compaq merger, carried out in May 2002 after a proxy fight of red-state/blue-state ferocity. Winner Fiorina moved briskly into integrating the two companies, brushing aside warnings she would fail. Time passed, and the company did not implode. True, its earnings progress was inconsistent and sometimes the stuff of headlines. And the stock was worrisome, since it went nowhere. Still, a general, vaguely based opinion began to develop, often reflected in the press, that this might be one merger that you couldn\'t condemn.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/why-carlys-big-bet-is-failing-fortune-classics-2005/\n\nSource 3:\nToday is Data Sheet’s tenth birthday, and on occasions like these it’s always fun to look back and see how much has changed over the years—and how much hasn’t.\n\nIt’s remarkable that the very first story mentioned in Data Sheet’s inaugural edition <https://fortune.com/2014/08/05/data-sheet-tuesday-august-5-2014/> was about HP accusing Autonomy founder Mike Lynch of fraud. That epic battle, which revolves around the $11 billion valuation at which HP bought Autonomy back in 2011, is still playing out a decade later.\nHP won its U.K. civil fraud case in 2022 and hopes <https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/hp-claims-4-bln-losses-london-lawsuit-over-autonomy-deal-2024-02-12/> to see the repayment of over $4 billion—but, while former Autonomy chief financial officer Sushovan Hussein received a five-year sentence in a U.S. criminal trial in 2019, Lynch himself was acquitted there in June of this year. (Lynch said <https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng14j5vqpo> last week that even though he was "ultra innocent," he would have been found guilty had he not been rich, due to the high costs of the U.S. justice system.)\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/intel-stock-plunge-data-sheet-decade/\n\nSource 4:\nGood morning. If you thought Larry Ellison was going to run Paramount, think again.\n\nA month ago, Skydance Media told the FCC that the Oracle founder would have voting control <https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/larry-ellison-fcc-revitalize-cbs-skydance-deal-1235992774/> of the media company formerly known as ViacomCBS when Skydance closes its $8 billion deal. It has now filed a revision saying no, it’s actually son David who calls the shots.\n\nWhy the confusion?

A few weeks ago, one secondhand but relatively credible report reached Fortune that the board is split over Fiorina. The two outside directors that we managed to talk to, though, Babbio and Knowling, firmly denied that was so. We did not get calls back from director Richard Hackborn, a strong-minded, retired HP executive who built the printer business. Hackborn played a key role in hiring Fiorina in 1999, and she is thought to need his continued support. Without it, her job might be imperiled. But don\'t forget that this board made this merger and has its own pride on the line.\n\nWhich way forward?\n\nWhich brings us to part two of our inquiry: assessing the future of Hewlett-Packard. As director Knowling says, "We\'re off the diving board."

In 2004 these included a thudding earnings miss for HP in its third fiscal quarter and a rousing bounceback in the fourth. In the minds of analysts hangs also the everlasting possibility that the "execution" Fiorina is promising might actually produce a long string of consistent quarters in which printers continue to shine and all the computer businesses suddenly wake up and do well.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/why-carlys-big-bet-is-failing-fortune-classics-2005/\n\nSource 2:\nBut celebrity, as everybody knows, isn\'t an achievement in itself. Beneath the public image are the yardsticks against which executives are — and should be — measured. So it is right to ask whether this whirlwind has succeeded. And inevitably that question must be answered in two parts. First, under the only lens that matters, did the famed merger that Fiorina engineered between HP <https://fortune.com/company/hp/> and Compaq produce value for HP\'s shareholders? Second, with that merger nearly three years past, is HP in shape to thrive in its brutally competitive world?\nThe answers are no and doubtful.\n\nThe merger\n\nLet\'s begin with that deeply controversial HP/Compaq merger, carried out in May 2002 after a proxy fight of red-state/blue-state ferocity. Winner Fiorina moved briskly into integrating the two companies, brushing aside warnings she would fail. Time passed, and the company did not implode. True, its earnings progress was inconsistent and sometimes the stuff of headlines. And the stock was worrisome, since it went nowhere. Still, a general, vaguely based opinion began to develop, often reflected in the press, that this might be one merger that you couldn\'t condemn.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/why-carlys-big-bet-is-failing-fortune-classics-2005/\n\nSource 3:\nToday is Data Sheet’s tenth birthday, and on occasions like these it’s always fun to look back and see how much has changed over the years—and how much hasn’t.\n\nIt’s remarkable that the very first story mentioned in Data Sheet’s inaugural edition <https://fortune.com/2014/08/05/data-sheet-tuesday-august-5-2014/> was about HP accusing Autonomy founder Mike Lynch of fraud.

(Lynch said <https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng14j5vqpo> last week that even though he was "ultra innocent," he would have been found guilty had he not been rich, due to the high costs of the U.S. justice system.)\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/intel-stock-plunge-data-sheet-decade/\n\nSource 4:\nGood morning.

Beneath the public image are the yardsticks against which executives are — and should be — measured. So it is right to ask whether this whirlwind has succeeded. And inevitably that question must be answered in two parts. First, under the only lens that matters, did the famed merger that Fiorina engineered between HP <https://fortune.com/company/hp/> and Compaq produce value for HP\'s shareholders? Second, with that merger nearly three years past, is HP in shape to thrive in its brutally competitive world?\nThe answers are no and doubtful.\n\nThe merger\n\nLet\'s begin with that deeply controversial HP/Compaq merger, carried out in May 2002 after a proxy fight of red-state/blue-state ferocity. Winner Fiorina moved briskly into integrating the two companies, brushing aside warnings she would fail. Time passed, and the company did not implode. True, its earnings progress was inconsistent and sometimes the stuff of headlines. And the stock was worrisome, since it went nowhere. Still, a general, vaguely based opinion began to develop, often reflected in the press, that this might be one merger that you couldn\'t condemn.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/why-carlys-big-bet-is-failing-fortune-classics-2005/\n\nSource 3:\nToday is Data Sheet’s tenth birthday, and on occasions like these it’s always fun to look back and see how much has changed over the years—and how much hasn’t.\n\nIt’s remarkable that the very first story mentioned in Data Sheet’s inaugural edition <https://fortune.com/2014/08/05/data-sheet-tuesday-august-5-2014/> was about HP accusing Autonomy founder Mike Lynch of fraud.

(Lynch said <https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng14j5vqpo> last week that even though he was "ultra innocent," he would have been found guilty had he not been rich, due to the high costs of the U.S. justice system.)\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/intel-stock-plunge-data-sheet-decade/\n\nSource 4:\nGood morning.

Scientists at NASA are hoping to find out.\n\nEuropa is the fourth-largest of Jupiter’s moons and has a saltwater ocean under its ice shell that has twice the amount of water contained in Earth’s oceans. Officials say that might mean it has the chemical elements necessary for life.\n\nThe Europa Clipper will explore that moon from above, looking for places below the planet’s surface that could support life. The spacecraft is set to lift off Monday at 12:06 p.m. ET. (The mission was originally scheduled for liftoff on Oct. 10, but was delayed due to the approach of Hurricane Milton.)\n\nThe Clipper\'s instruments will perform a comprehensive survey of the planet, from its core and its 10- to 15-mile-thick ice shell to the oceans and thin atmosphere. Planning for the mission began in 2013, but was slow to become reality as NASA struggled to create a spacecraft that could withstand the radiation emanating from Jupiter (which is 20,000 times that found on Earth).\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/14/nasa-launch-europa-clipper-mission-jupiter-moon-suitable-life/\n\nSource 1:\nThe spacecraft, the largest NASA <https://fortune.com/2017/11/07/jupiter-nasa-photos-juno/> has ever built for a planetary mission, will travel 1.8 million miles to reach Jupiter in April of 2030. It will conduct 49 close flybys of Europa and orbit Jupiter. Flybys will take place every two or three weeks and will bring Clipper within 16 miles of the surface.\n\nWhile the stated mission of the orbiter is to “determine if Europa has conditions suitable to support life,” scientists aren’t looking for existing life on the moon. They’re more interested to learn more about the composition of the ocean and what is behind plumes that have been seen shooting up through the ice. \n\nAnd, of course, they want to know whether it’s habitable, as NASA says “abundant liquid water, energy, and the right chemical elements make Europa one of the best places in the solar system to seek present-day life beyond Earth.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/14/nasa-launch-europa-clipper-mission-jupiter-moon-suitable-life/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/14/nasa-launch-europa-clipper-mission-jupiter-moon-suitable-life/\n\nSource 2:\nThat is, of course, the other matter of constant interest: Just how solidly is the board behind Fiorina?

We did not get calls back from director Richard Hackborn, a strong-minded, retired HP executive who built the printer business.

2024-11-07 23:10:47,588: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter. According to the article from Fortune.com, NASA is planning to launch a spacecraft called the Europa Clipper to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, which has a saltwater ocean under its ice shell that has twice the amount of water contained in Earth's oceans [1]. The spacecraft will travel 1.8 million miles to reach Jupiter in April of 2030 and will conduct 49 close flybys of Europa and orbit Jupiter [1]. Jupiter is a massive planet, and its radiation is 20,000 times that found on Earth, which made it a challenge for NASA to create a spacecraft that could withstand it [1].

Jupiter's size and radiation are just a few of its unique features. The planet's massive size and strong radiation make it an interesting subject for scientists to study. The Europa Clipper mission is focused on determining if Europa has conditions suitable to support

According to the article from Fortune.com, NASA is planning to launch a spacecraft called the Europa Clipper to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, which has a saltwater ocean under its ice shell that has twice the amount of water contained in Earth's oceans [1]. The spacecraft will travel 1.8 million miles to reach Jupiter in April of 2030 and will conduct 49 close flybys of Europa and orbit Jupiter [1]. Jupiter is a massive planet, and its radiation is 20,000 times that found on Earth, which made it a challenge for NASA to create a spacecraft that could withstand it [1].

Jupiter's size and radiation are just a few of its unique features. The planet's massive size and strong radiation make it an interesting subject for scientists to study. The Europa Clipper mission is focused on determining if Europa has conditions suitable to support life, and scientists are interested in learning more about the composition of the ocean and what is behind plumes that have been seen shooting

2024-11-07 23:10:47,853: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter. According to the article from Fortune.com, NASA is planning to launch a spacecraft called the Europa Clipper to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, which has a saltwater ocean under its ice shell that has twice the amount of water contained in Earth's oceans [1]. The spacecraft will travel 1.8 million miles to reach Jupiter in April of 2030 and will conduct 49 close flybys of Europa and orbit Jupiter [1]. Jupiter is a massive planet, and its radiation is 20,000 times that found on Earth, which made it a challenge for NASA to create a spacecraft that could withstand it [1].

Jupiter's size and radiation are just a few of its unique features. The planet's massive size and strong radiation make it an interesting subject for scientists to study. The Europa Clipper mission is focused on determining if Europa has conditions suitable to support life, and scientists are interested in learning more about the composition of the ocean and what is behind plumes that have been seen shooting up through the ice [1].

According to the article from Fortune.com, NASA is planning to launch a spacecraft called the Europa Clipper to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, which has a saltwater ocean under its ice shell that has twice the amount of water contained in Earth's oceans [1]. The spacecraft will travel 1.8 million miles to reach Jupiter in April of 2030 and will conduct 49 close flybys of Europa and orbit Jupiter [1]. Jupiter is a massive planet, and its radiation is 20,000 times that found on Earth, which made it a challenge for NASA to create a spacecraft that could withstand it [1].

Jupiter's size and radiation are just a few of its unique features. The planet's massive size and strong radiation make it an interesting subject for scientists to study. The Europa Clipper mission is focused on determining if Europa has conditions suitable to support life, and scientists are interested in learning more about the composition of the ocean and what is behind plumes that have been seen shooting up through the ice [1]. Jupiter's moon Europa is one of the best places in the solar system to seek present-day life beyond Earth, according to NASA [1].

2024-11-07 23:10:48,192: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter. According to the article from Fortune.com, NASA is planning to launch a spacecraft called the Europa Clipper to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, which has a saltwater ocean under its ice shell that has twice the amount of water contained in Earth's oceans [1]. The spacecraft will travel 1.8 million miles to reach Jupiter in April of 2030 and will conduct 49 close flybys of Europa and orbit Jupiter [1]. Jupiter is a massive planet, and its radiation is 20,000 times that found on Earth, which made it a challenge for NASA to create a spacecraft that could withstand it [1].

Jupiter's size and radiation are just a few of its unique features. The planet's massive size and strong radiation make it an interesting subject for scientists to study. The Europa Clipper mission is focused on determining if Europa has conditions suitable to support life, and scientists are interested in learning more about the composition of the ocean and what is behind plumes that have been seen shooting up through the ice [1]. Jupiter's moon Europa is one of the best places in the solar system to seek present-day life beyond Earth, according to NASA [1].

The exploration of Jupiter and its moon Europa is an exciting area of research, and the Europa Clipper mission is a significant step forward in

2024-11-07 23:10:48,347: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter. According to the article from Fortune.com, NASA is planning to launch a spacecraft called the Europa Clipper to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, which has a saltwater ocean under its ice shell that has twice the amount of water contained in Earth's oceans [1]. The spacecraft will travel 1.8 million miles to reach Jupiter in April of 2030 and will conduct 49 close flybys of Europa and orbit Jupiter [1]. Jupiter is a massive planet, and its radiation is 20,000 times that found on Earth, which made it a challenge for NASA to create a spacecraft that could withstand it [1].

Jupiter's size and radiation are just a few of its unique features. The planet's massive size and strong radiation make it an interesting subject for scientists to study. The Europa Clipper mission is focused on determining if Europa has conditions suitable to support life, and scientists are interested in learning more about the composition of the ocean and what is behind plumes that have been seen shooting up through the ice [1]. Jupiter's moon Europa is one of the best places in the solar system to seek present-day life beyond Earth, according to NASA [1].

2024-11-07 23:10:48,414: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter. According to the article from Fortune.com, NASA is planning to launch a spacecraft called the Europa Clipper to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, which has a saltwater ocean under its ice shell that has twice the amount of water contained in Earth's oceans [1]. The spacecraft will travel 1.8 million miles to reach Jupiter in April of 2030 and will conduct 49 close flybys of Europa and orbit Jupiter [1]. Jupiter is a massive planet, and its radiation is 20,000 times that found on Earth, which made it a challenge for NASA to create a spacecraft that could withstand it [1].

Jupiter's size and radiation are just a few of its unique features. The planet's massive size and strong radiation make it an interesting subject for scientists to study. The Europa Clipper mission is focused on determining if Europa has conditions suitable to support life, and scientists are interested in learning more about the composition of the ocean and what is behind plumes that have been seen shooting up through the ice [1]. Jupiter's moon Europa is one of the best places in the solar system to seek present-day life beyond Earth, according to NASA [1].

The exploration of Jupiter and its moon Europa is an exciting area of research, and the Europa Clipper mission is a significant step forward in our understanding of the planet and its potential for supporting life. With its massive size and unique features, Jupiter remains a fascinating subject for scientists and astronomers alike.
