People who are less able — or less willing — to spend that much had in many cases held on to their existing vehicles for years. The time had come for them to replace them.

People who are less able — or less willing — to spend that much had in many cases held on to their existing vehicles for years. The time had come for them to replace them.

It also warned people to have the car inspected before purchasing, even if they went with a Consumer Reports pick.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/28/consumer-reports-used-car-rankings/\n\nSource 2:\nAmid a 19.6% price increase <https://perc.tamu.edu/blog/2024/02/price-trends-for-cars.html#:~:text=The%20price%20of%20new%20vehicles,increased%2018%25%20since%20January%202021.> of automobiles from January 2021 to 2024, most of these compact SUVs are under $30,000, with many under $25,000—a stark difference from the $60,000 price tag <https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2023/09/29/heres-how-much-pickup-truck-prices-skyrocketed-during-the-pandemic-era/> of a pickup truck and an easier-to-swallow pill. Often with lower interest rates <https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/money/auto-loan-interest-rates-by-credit-score> than even gently used cars and similar features to their larger counterparts, smaller vehicles have become a formidable alternative.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/30/small-cars-trucks-inflation-ozempic-monster-auto/\n\nSource 2:\nBut the industry will continue to make changes to appeal to those looking for compact, affordable cars. Moody notes that the No. 4 best-selling car below the top-three pickup juggernauts is the stalwart Toyota <https://fortune.com/company/toyota-tsusho/> Rav 4, which led the trend of compact SUVs after its introduction 30 years ago <https://www.millertoyota.com/2-full-decades-of-rav4-history/>. He expects the compact Toyota model to continue to creep up <https://www.roadandtrack.com/reviews/a60688493/2024-toyota-rav4-trd-off-road-first-drive/> the rankings as compact cars continue to rise in popularity. \n\nMoody also expects more hybrid compact SUVs to emerge, particularly as an alternative to electric vehicles, which, because of their large and heavy batteries <https://www.axios.com/2023/04/28/evs-weight-safety-problems>, are often oversized and expensive. Even EV producers are aware of the pitfalls of large electric cars, and they’re aiming to produce smaller autos.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/30/small-cars-trucks-inflation-ozempic-monster-auto/\n\nSource 3:\nAs recently as last year, it was hard to find a new electric car for less than $50,000 <https://fortune.com/2024/01/25/what-electric-vehicles-cost-less-than-50000-dollars-2024-cheap-evs/>. But over the past few months, automakers have cut prices <https://fortune.com/2024/02/21/tesla-price-cuts-driving-down-car-values-ev-makers-sending-checks-leasing-firms-compensate-them/>; the used market has helped fill the gap for budget-conscious buyers <https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/used-electric-vehicle-buying-report>; and new tax incentives are allowing dealers to cut up to $4,000 off the sticker price of some used and leased EVs at the point of sale—bringing prices down even further.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/16/used-electric-car-ev-market-value-falling-lease-ownership-assets-adoption/\n\nSource 4:\nIt helps that Uncle Sam is lending a hand. While clean vehicle tax credits worth as much $7,500 for buyers of new EVs has gotten the most attention since the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the law also created $4,000 credits toward the purchase of used plug-in models costing $25,000 or less. Whereas manufacturers have to meet strict criteria for their new EVs to quality for incentives, used electric cars qualify as long as they’re below that price threshold and at least roughly two years old.\n\nTesla’s reluctance to update its lineup is another reason why its second-hand EVs are looking relatively attractive, said Jessica Caldwell <https://www.edmunds.com/about/authors/jessica-caldwell.html>, Edmunds’ head of insights. The US manufacturer hasn’t substantially updated its four-year-old Model Y sport utility vehicle, and its refresh of the Model 3 didn’t drastically alter the look of the sedan introduced seven years ago.\n\nDrivers can snap up a used Model 3 for $22,000 and “it doesn’t look that different than a new one,” Caldwell said. Most used EVs “are a good deal.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/23/tesla-price-cuts-used-ev-market-surge/\n\nSource 5:\nHertz did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nYet Hertz’s misfortune is a dream for used-car buyers looking for a good deal. On the company’s website, potential buyers can find Teslas ranging in price from $21,000 to $36,000, the majority of which are models from 2022 and 2023. Hertz is also selling several 2023 Chevy Bolt SUVs for about $16,000. Prices for the vehicles vary in part due to the miles they have accrued. Some of the vehicles have higher-than-average mile counts for their age because they’ve been used as rental cars.\nThe long race to market a new affordable EV is slowly becoming a reality in the U.S. due to fierce competition between Tesla, Hyundai-Kia <https://fortune.com/company/kia-motors/>, and General Motors, according to data from Bloomberg Green <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/long-range-evs-now-cost-less-than-the-average-us-new-car?cmpid=BBD060724_hyperdrive&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=240607&utm_campaign=hyperdrive&sref=2jPYL79S>. Each of these companies now offer long range electric vehicles that can travel for 300 miles without stopping to charge for less than the average price of a new car in the U.S. Still, the cheapest model, the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 6, costs $47,000. On the horizon are a soon-to-come $25,000 electric Jeep that Stellantis <https://fortune.com/company/stellantis/> announced\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/buy-used-tesla-hertz-fire-sale/\n\nSource 6:\n$21,692\n\n-$5,769\n\n-21.0%\n\n\n3\n\nMaserati Levante\n\n$43,710\n\n-$11,086\n\n-20.2%\n\n\n4\n\nNissan <https://fortune.com/company/nissan-motor/> Leaf\n\n$16,243\n\n-$4,102\n\n-20.2%\n\n\n5\n\nHyundai <https://fortune.com/company/hyundai-mobis/> Kona Electric\n\n$21,466\n\n-$4,873\n\n-18.5%\n\n\n6\n\nChevrolet Bolt EV\n\n$17,863\n\n-$3,997\n\n-18.3%\n\n\n7\n\nJaguar E-PACE\n\n$26,477\n\n-$5,149\n\n-16.3%\n\n\n8\n\nLand Rover Range Rover Sport\n\n$53,071\n\n-$9,528\n\n-15.2%\n\n\n9\n\nLand Rover Range Rover Evoque\n\n$30,506\n\n-$5,395\n\n-15.0%\n\n\n10\n\nLand Rover Range Rover Velar\n\n$37,642\n\n-$6,652\n\n-15.0%\n\n\n11\n\nRam 1500 Classic\n\n$26,413\n\n-$4,634\n\n-14.9%\n$26,413\n\n-$4,634\n\n-14.9%\n\n\n12\n\nMercedes-Benz AMG GT\n\n$79,808\n\n-$13,840\n\n-14.8%\n\n\n13\n\nBMW X7\n\n$55,333\n\n-$8,899\n\n-13.9%\n\n\n14\n\nBMW X2\n\n$24,878\n\n-$3,874\n\n-13.5%\n\n\n15\n\nTesla Model S\n\n$53,141\n\n-$8,255\n\n-13.4%\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/10/used-ev-prices-vs-gas-cars/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/10/used-ev-prices-vs-gas-cars/\n\nSource 7:\nFord's F-Series truck remains the top-selling vehicle in the United States this year, as it has been for nearly a half-century, followed by the Chevrolet Silverado. But Stellantis' Ram pickup, typically No. 3, dropped to sixth place, outpaced by several less expensive small SUVs: the Toyota <https://fortune.com/company/toyota-tsusho/> RAV4, the Honda <https://fortune.com/company/honda-motor/> CR-V and the Tesla <https://fortune.com/company/tesla/> Model Y (with a $7,500 U.S. tax credit).\n\nThe move in buyer sentiment toward affordability came fast this year, catching many automakers off guard, with too-few vehicles available in lower price ranges. One reason for the shift, analysts say, is that many buyers who are willing to plunk down nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle had already done so in the past few years. People who are less able — or less willing — to spend that much had in many cases held on to their existing vehicles for years. The time had come for them to replace them. And most of them seem disinclined to spend more than they have to.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/22/car-buyers-switching-discount-models/\n\nSource 7:\nTo buy a new car at that price, an average buyer would have to spend $737 a month, if financed at today's average loan rate of 7.1%, for just under six years before the vehicle would be paid off, according to Edmunds.com, an auto research and pricing site. For many, that is financially out of reach.\n\nYet there are other buyers who, like Chumley, could manage the financial burden but have decided it just isn't worth the cost. And the trend is forcing America's automakers to reassess their sales and production strategies. With buyers confronting inflated prices and still-high loan rates, sales of new U.S. autos rose only 1% through September over the same period last year. If the trend toward lower-priced vehicles proves a lasting one, more generous discounts could lead to lower average auto prices and slowing industry profits.\n\n“Consumers are becoming more prudent as they face economic uncertainty, still-high interest rates and vehicle prices that remain elevated,” said Kevin Roberts, director of market intelligence at CarGurus, an automotive shopping site. “This year, all of the growth is happening in what we would consider the more affordable price buckets.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/22/car-buyers-switching-discount-models/\n\nSource 8:\nforth to work and you're really not taking it long distances. Well, it may be a fine place for you to have one. So it really depends on the person and what their lifestyle is and what they're looking for, the needs that they have.\nBrady: You know, you have to be a friend to so many in the auto sector. It's such a fascinating sector to be in. So perhaps this is just a factual question with regard to top trade-ins and such, but are you seeing any trends that are on your radar? You want to put on ours on that front that perhaps are indicative of different ways of buying or even different types of models that we're seeking out?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/25/carmax-ceo-bill-nash-selling-evs/"}

But Stellantis' Ram pickup, typically No. 3, dropped to sixth place, outpaced by several less expensive small SUVs: the Toyota <https://fortune.com/company/toyota-tsusho/> RAV4, the Honda <https://fortune.com/company/honda-motor/> CR-V and the Tesla <https://fortune.com/company/tesla/> Model Y (with a $7,500 U.S. tax credit).\n\nThe move in buyer sentiment toward affordability came fast this year, catching many automakers off guard, with too-few vehicles available in lower price ranges. One reason for the shift, analysts say, is that many buyers who are willing to plunk down nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle had already done so in the past few years. People who are less able — or less willing — to spend that much had in many cases held on to their existing vehicles for years. The time had come for them to replace them. And most of them seem disinclined to spend more than they have to.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/22/car-buyers-switching-discount-models/\n\nSource 7:\nTo buy a new car at that price, an average buyer would have to spend $737 a month, if financed at today's average loan rate of 7.1%, for just under six years before the vehicle would be paid off, according to Edmunds.com, an auto research and pricing site. For many, that is financially out of reach.\n\nYet there are other buyers who, like Chumley, could manage the financial burden but have decided it just isn't worth the cost. And the trend is forcing America's automakers to reassess their sales and production strategies. With buyers confronting inflated prices and still-high loan rates, sales of new U.S. autos rose only 1% through September over the same period last year. If the trend toward lower-priced vehicles proves a lasting one, more generous discounts could lead to lower average auto prices and slowing industry profits.\n\n“Consumers are becoming more prudent as they face economic uncertainty, still-high interest rates and vehicle prices that remain elevated,” said Kevin Roberts, director of market intelligence at CarGurus, an automotive shopping site. “This year, all of the growth is happening in what we would consider the more affordable price buckets.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/22/car-buyers-switching-discount-models/\n\nSource 8:\nforth to work and you're really not taking it long distances.

But Stellantis' Ram pickup, typically No. 3, dropped to sixth place, outpaced by several less expensive small SUVs: the Toyota <https://fortune.com/company/toyota-tsusho/> RAV4, the Honda <https://fortune.com/company/honda-motor/> CR-V and the Tesla <https://fortune.com/company/tesla/> Model Y (with a $7,500 U.S. tax credit).\n\nThe move in buyer sentiment toward affordability came fast this year, catching many automakers off guard, with too-few vehicles available in lower price ranges. One reason for the shift, analysts say, is that many buyers who are willing to plunk down nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle had already done so in the past few years. People who are less able — or less willing — to spend that much had in many cases held on to their existing vehicles for years. The time had come for them to replace them. And most of them seem disinclined to spend more than they have to.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/22/car-buyers-switching-discount-models/\n\nSource 7:\nTo buy a new car at that price, an average buyer would have to spend $737 a month, if financed at today's average loan rate of 7.1%, for just under six years before the vehicle would be paid off, according to Edmunds.com, an auto research and pricing site. For many, that is financially out of reach.\n\nYet there are other buyers who, like Chumley, could manage the financial burden but have decided it just isn't worth the cost. And the trend is forcing America's automakers to reassess their sales and production strategies. With buyers confronting inflated prices and still-high loan rates, sales of new U.S. autos rose only 1% through September over the same period last year. If the trend toward lower-priced vehicles proves a lasting one, more generous discounts could lead to lower average auto prices and slowing industry profits.\n\n“Consumers are becoming more prudent as they face economic uncertainty, still-high interest rates and vehicle prices that remain elevated,” said Kevin Roberts, director of market intelligence at CarGurus, an automotive shopping site. “This year, all of the growth is happening in what we would consider the more affordable price buckets.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/22/car-buyers-switching-discount-models/\n\nSource 8:\nforth to work and you're really not taking it long distances.

It also warned people to have the car inspected before purchasing, even if they went with a Consumer Reports pick.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/28/consumer-reports-used-car-rankings/\n\nSource 2:\nAmid a 19.6% price increase <https://perc.tamu.edu/blog/2024/02/price-trends-for-cars.html#:~:text=The%20price%20of%20new%20vehicles,increased%2018%25%20since%20January%202021.> of automobiles from January 2021 to 2024, most of these compact SUVs are under $30,000, with many under $25,000—a stark difference from the $60,000 price tag <https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2023/09/29/heres-how-much-pickup-truck-prices-skyrocketed-during-the-pandemic-era/> of a pickup truck and an easier-to-swallow pill. Often with lower interest rates <https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/money/auto-loan-interest-rates-by-credit-score> than even gently used cars and similar features to their larger counterparts, smaller vehicles have become a formidable alternative.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/30/small-cars-trucks-inflation-ozempic-monster-auto/\n\nSource 2:\nBut the industry will continue to make changes to appeal to those looking for compact, affordable cars. Moody notes that the No. 4 best-selling car below the top-three pickup juggernauts is the stalwart Toyota <https://fortune.com/company/toyota-tsusho/> Rav 4, which led the trend of compact SUVs after its introduction 30 years ago <https://www.millertoyota.com/2-full-decades-of-rav4-history/>. He expects the compact Toyota model to continue to creep up <https://www.roadandtrack.com/reviews/a60688493/2024-toyota-rav4-trd-off-road-first-drive/> the rankings as compact cars continue to rise in popularity. \n\nMoody also expects more hybrid compact SUVs to emerge, particularly as an alternative to electric vehicles, which, because of their large and heavy batteries <https://www.axios.com/2023/04/28/evs-weight-safety-problems>, are often oversized and expensive. Even EV producers are aware of the pitfalls of large electric cars, and they’re aiming to produce smaller autos.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/30/small-cars-trucks-inflation-ozempic-monster-auto/\n\nSource 3:\nAs recently as last year, it was hard to find a new electric car for less than $50,000 <https://fortune.com/2024/01/25/what-electric-vehicles-cost-less-than-50000-dollars-2024-cheap-evs/>. But over the past few months, automakers have cut prices <https://fortune.com/2024/02/21/tesla-price-cuts-driving-down-car-values-ev-makers-sending-checks-leasing-firms-compensate-them/>; the used market has helped fill the gap for budget-conscious buyers <https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/used-electric-vehicle-buying-report>; and new tax incentives are allowing dealers to cut up to $4,000 off the sticker price of some used and leased EVs at the point of sale—bringing prices down even further.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/16/used-electric-car-ev-market-value-falling-lease-ownership-assets-adoption/\n\nSource 4:\nIt helps that Uncle Sam is lending a hand. While clean vehicle tax credits worth as much $7,500 for buyers of new EVs has gotten the most attention since the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the law also created $4,000 credits toward the purchase of used plug-in models costing $25,000 or less. Whereas manufacturers have to meet strict criteria for their new EVs to quality for incentives, used electric cars qualify as long as they’re below that price threshold and at least roughly two years old.\n\nTesla’s reluctance to update its lineup is another reason why its second-hand EVs are looking relatively attractive, said Jessica Caldwell <https://www.edmunds.com/about/authors/jessica-caldwell.html>, Edmunds’ head of insights. The US manufacturer hasn’t substantially updated its four-year-old Model Y sport utility vehicle, and its refresh of the Model 3 didn’t drastically alter the look of the sedan introduced seven years ago.\n\nDrivers can snap up a used Model 3 for $22,000 and “it doesn’t look that different than a new one,” Caldwell said. Most used EVs “are a good deal.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/23/tesla-price-cuts-used-ev-market-surge/\n\nSource 5:\nHertz did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nYet Hertz’s misfortune is a dream for used-car buyers looking for a good deal. On the company’s website, potential buyers can find Teslas ranging in price from $21,000 to $36,000, the majority of which are models from 2022 and 2023. Hertz is also selling several 2023 Chevy Bolt SUVs for about $16,000. Prices for the vehicles vary in part due to the miles they have accrued. Some of the vehicles have higher-than-average mile counts for their age because they’ve been used as rental cars.\nThe long race to market a new affordable EV is slowly becoming a reality in the U.S. due to fierce competition between Tesla, Hyundai-Kia <https://fortune.com/company/kia-motors/>, and General Motors, according to data from Bloomberg Green <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/long-range-evs-now-cost-less-than-the-average-us-new-car?cmpid=BBD060724_hyperdrive&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=240607&utm_campaign=hyperdrive&sref=2jPYL79S>.
