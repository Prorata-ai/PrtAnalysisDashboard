Like any revolution, this one has plenty of confusion, uncertainty, and casualties. As patterns of competition change and artificially protected preserves are opened up, weak firms must seek shelter or get trampled upon and strong ones cannot take their strength for granted.

The business community that started out with the best reasons to be frightened now embraces the new adventure with the most enthusiasm. A few years ago France looked like the weak sister of Europe.

The Chinese, on everything around the post-carbon transition—not just EVs and batteries and the critical mineral supply chain, but also solar and wind and nuclear at scale. The Americans, on the other hand, [are] increasingly dominant in AI, large language models and frontier models, and the funding for that.”\n\n“If the Chinese want to regulate to ensure that their own population doesn't have access to good AI models and the Americans want to regulate to ensure that American citizens have to drive crappy, expensive EVs, we're both capable of doing that. But the rest of the world isn't going to do that and that is going to be a driver of more intellectual capital and capital and goods and services moving across borders all over the world.”", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.61937255), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='cbf20c5b-9155-41f1-844f-db6c52b66089', embedding=None, metadata={'id': 'ba88aa52eb5db00bb91486326198d2bad2af37009e3b687d42f4c81c0d12e64d-1', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': 'ba88aa52eb5db00bb91486326198d2bad2af37009e3b687d42f4c81c0d12e64d', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20240905, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-07', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1928433878-e1725531970119.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2024, 'date_month': 9, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/2024/09/05/world-reglobalizing-multinationals-business-us-china-geopolitics-tariffs-trade-leadership/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 5, 'title': 'The world is ‘reglobalizing’—and multinationals can’t keep doing business as usual', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/2024/09/05/world-reglobalizing-multinationals-business-us-china-geopolitics-tariffs-trade-leadership/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Large global businesses are not passive or reactive players in the emerging reglobalized world.

Nevertheless, businessmen are behaving as if national borders had already disappeared. They are merging and consolidating, forming joint ventures, and setting up bases to assault new markets. The resulting upheaval must be what Jean Monnet, prophet of European union, had in mind when he predicted that the Common Market would touch off "a second industrial revolution." Like any revolution, this one has plenty of confusion, uncertainty, and casualties. As patterns of competition change and artificially protected preserves are opened up, weak firms must seek shelter or get trampled upon and strong ones cannot take their strength for granted. Yet everyone seems to be looking forward with gusto to the test. A few businessmen expressed concern about what the Common Market might do to their immediate prospects, but none even hinted that he would like to see the process stopped or reversed. The business community that started out with the best reasons to be frightened now embraces the new adventure with the most enthusiasm. A few years ago France looked like the weak sister of Europe. Its politics were in disorder, its morale depressed by the impasse in Algeria. Moreover, its notoriously inefficient industry, fragmented into old, tariff-protected family firms, seemed\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/old-europes-young-again-and-fretting-fortune-classics-1963/\n\nSource 2:\nAs a result of these shifts, the digital world has never been more fragmented. But we are not here to argue that all digital barriers must come down. As researchers from academic institutions in the U.S. (Harvard), Europe (INSEAD), and China (Tsinghua), and from a global company (Boston Consulting Group), we recognize that governments will continue to feel an obligation to protect their national security interests and citizens’ data. If anything, we may see more barriers erected in the years to come. But we shouldn’t—in fact, we can’t—give up on cross-border data sharing.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/ai-artificial-intelligence-cross-border-data-sharing/\n\nSource 2:\nRecent events have illustrated the positive impact of sharing—not only within industries (as we have recently argued <https://fortune.com/2024/05/03/potential-unleashed-data-sharing-bcg/>) but also across borders. For example, it took Mayo Clinic <https://fortune.com/company/mayo-clinic/> researchers in the United States just six weeks <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00147-9/fulltext> to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases. This experience, though enabled by the exceptional circumstance of a global pandemic <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-023-00773-0>, is still illustrative of the power of sharing. But if the rise in data regulation continues at its current rate, such cross-border data sharing will become more and more difficult. This would have major implications, both on the global economy and on our collective ability to address issues that can only be solved by using data from multiple countries, such as anticipating natural disasters\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/ai-artificial-intelligence-cross-border-data-sharing/\n\nSource 2:\nWhether preparing for the next pandemic or monitoring the safety of generative AI, policymakers, business leaders, and academics need access to data from both within and outside their national borders. But instead of policies that enable data to flow more freely, constraints have become the norm. Globally, data flow restrictions more than doubled between 2017 and 2021 <https://itif.org/publications/2021/07/19/how-barriers-cross-border-data-flows-are-spreading-globally-what-they-cost/>. Late last year, the U.S. withdrew its long-standing request for the WTO <https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-drops-digital-trade-demands-wto-allow-room-stronger-tech-regulation-2023-10-25/> to prohibit data localization requirements for e-commerce. This is a highly symbolic move from a country that has traditionally been one of the staunchest supporters of tearing down barriers in the digital world.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/ai-artificial-intelligence-cross-border-data-sharing/\n\nSource 3:\nTo make this possible, we expect to see corporate structures move from a hub-and-spoke model to a web model, shaped by demand for local knowledge, relationships, data privacy rules, local content and compliance demands, and the ever-shortening viable time to market. For blocs that align more closely (such as North America and the EU), alignment solutions will be found, whereas competing blocs (such as North America and China) will struggle to find a stable solution for the range of interactions that are either unavoidable or commercially compelling.\n\nPotential high-growth emerging economies will have leverage in pursuing their national interests by maintaining an unaligned position with respect to the strategic competition between China and the U.S. The current oil market exemplifies this dynamic in the interplay between allowed and sanctioned trade.\n\nThis will result in clusters of expertise and supporting supply chain infrastructure appearing in multiple countries, with virtual teams supplanting physically co-located teams.\n\nClusters add robustness and redundancy—but they also make it harder to exclude rivals from the global system. It is unclear whether the existing international organizations that support rules-based behaviors and effective dispute resolution will recover their importance and effectiveness.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/us-china-competition-benefiting-worldand-global-economy-supply-chains-politics-leadership/\n\nSource 4:\nThe critical takeaway is that we need to consider scenarios for the 2030s <https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/geopolitical-risk-rising-how-ceos-prepare>—a time horizon beyond the typical two-to-three-year corporate planning cycle, but not so distant that the scenarios are too theoretical or academic to be useful.\n\nHow geopolitics could reshape the world by 2032\n\nThe least likely scenario today—because of stagnant WTO reforms, the UN’s inability to stop conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, and the rise of protectionist industrial policies <>— <>is a return to the days of global cooperation and peace. Western-values-based global institutions and peace mechanisms would regain dominance, and as sanctions and conflicts recede, global trade would reach historic highs.\n\nA more likely scenario envisions the proliferation of regional conflicts. Although total global trade would be stable, regionalization would shift its flows, and supply shocks would multiply. These disruptions would strain commodity markets, while sanctions complicate capital flows. Global talent flows would also be obstructed.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/07/geopolitics-4-potential-scenarios-map-world-trade-goods-next-decade-bcg-politics/\n\nSource 5:\nGood morning,\n\nFor most Fortune 500 CEOs, globalization is a given. Their challenge is figuring out how to navigate geopolitics while conducting business in a connected world. We convened two dozen members of the Fortune CEO Initiative yesterday for a candid conversation with Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer, who consults with leaders worldwide. Here are a few of his comments:\n\nOn China: “Along with neither side wanting escalating tensions, the Americans and Chinese are increasingly dominant in different and complementary technologies. The Chinese, on everything around the post-carbon transition—not just EVs and batteries and the critical mineral supply chain, but also solar and wind and nuclear at scale. The Americans, on the other hand, [are] increasingly dominant in AI, large language models and frontier models, and the funding for that.”\n\n“If the Chinese want to regulate to ensure that their own population doesn\'t have access to good AI models and the Americans want to regulate to ensure that American citizens have to drive crappy, expensive EVs, we\'re both capable of doing that. But the rest of the world isn\'t going to do that and that is going to be a driver of more intellectual capital and capital and goods and services moving across borders all over the world.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/ian-bremmer-gaza-ukraine-wars-markets-eurasia-group/\n\nSource 6:\nLarge global businesses are not passive or reactive players in the emerging reglobalized world. Businesses expand and consolidate through organic growth and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity, often crossing many borders in the process. Their financial scale, internal trade (with each other and amongst their own subsidiaries), and investments are themselves among the most powerful change agents shaping the future of world trade and investment.\n\nThe era of supply chain and market growth concentration has come to an end, and with it, the singular focus on cost efficiency at the expense of risk management. How C-suites approach key strategic planning choices will be ever more challenging as scale, complexity, and enabling technologies such as AI evolve, not to mention geopolitical, climate, economic, and consumer developments.\n\nThinking in terms of ‘world states’\n\nReglobalization is going to be turbulent and non-linear in its progression. When working with executives, we encourage the development of a mutually exclusive, completely exhaustive (MECE) set of scenarios on a spectrum that ranges from everyone all over the world holding hands to a major regional war. The more probable scenarios are in the middle. In developing the scenarios, three or four realistic ones are sufficient.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/05/world-reglobalizing-multinationals-business-us-china-geopolitics-tariffs-trade-leadership/\n\nSource 7:\nSuch interconnectedness that blurs the lines separating nations, complicates the whole idea of imposing sanctions on one nation or another. As a result, Smith is skeptical that the tariffs imposed on imports by both Biden and Trump before him will resolve the geopolitical tension. To support his skepticism, he cites research <https://www.ft.com/content/497ca6af-1565-443a-ad18-3e9180d04d5e> by the Financial Times that he says shows tariffs slow trade for everyone. Instead, he thinks properly recognizing the interconnectedness of global markets might lead to more measured solutions.\n\n“Everybody looks at China as a monolithic entity," he said. "There\'s a business class in China that doesn\'t want to be wiped out either, as China has become more protectionist. And if you go into a FedEx hub today, you\'ll be amazed at the choreography of stuff going from every part in the world to every other part in the world.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/17/fedex-founder-says-corporate-data-predicted-the-rise-of-tesla-and-nvidiaand-can-flag-new-trends/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/17/fedex-founder-says-corporate-data-predicted-the-rise-of-tesla-and-nvidiaand-can-flag-new-trends/\n\nSource 8:\nNo way out?\n\nCapgemini’s Ezzat told Fortune the many companies considering "friendshoring" in the last decade, as the geopolitical landscape turned increasingly frosty, have found themselves faced with a series of obstacles. \n\n“You have a geopolitical situation where people realize the world is not completely open, which means you have to manage that risk, in terms of how you manage your global supply chain, your sourcing, your exchanges,” Ezzat said.\n\nThe cost of enhanced supply chain security is likely to be economic inefficiencies. A worst-case scenario could put that cost into the trillions.\n\nGita Gopinath, first managing deputy director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that a potential “Cold War II” could wipe $7 trillion <https://fortune.com/europe/2023/12/12/cold-war-two-imf-deputy-gita-gopinath-wipe-trillions-dollars-from-global-economy/> of dollars from global GDP as a result of trade wars.\n\nStill, while Ezzat agrees there are economic costs to nearshoring, he and Capgemini regard it as advantageous over the long term.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/01/21/europe-global-chip-dependency-tech-consulting-capgemini/\n\nSource 9:\nBitcoin as neutral solution\n\nAs anyone who has used Venmo or Zelle can attest, moving money within the U.S. is free and easy. The same is true within other countries.

Their challenge is figuring out how to navigate geopolitics while conducting business in a connected world. We convened two dozen members of the Fortune CEO Initiative yesterday for a candid conversation with Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer, who consults with leaders worldwide. Here are a few of his comments:\n\nOn China: “Along with neither side wanting escalating tensions, the Americans and Chinese are increasingly dominant in different and complementary technologies. The Chinese, on everything around the post-carbon transition—not just EVs and batteries and the critical mineral supply chain, but also solar and wind and nuclear at scale. The Americans, on the other hand, [are] increasingly dominant in AI, large language models and frontier models, and the funding for that.”\n\n“If the Chinese want to regulate to ensure that their own population doesn\'t have access to good AI models and the Americans want to regulate to ensure that American citizens have to drive crappy, expensive EVs, we\'re both capable of doing that. But the rest of the world isn\'t going to do that and that is going to be a driver of more intellectual capital and capital and goods and services moving across borders all over the world.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/ian-bremmer-gaza-ukraine-wars-markets-eurasia-group/\n\nSource 6:\nLarge global businesses are not passive or reactive players in the emerging reglobalized world. Businesses expand and consolidate through organic growth and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity, often crossing many borders in the process. Their financial scale, internal trade (with each other and amongst their own subsidiaries), and investments are themselves among the most powerful change agents shaping the future of world trade and investment.\n\nThe era of supply chain and market growth concentration has come to an end, and with it, the singular focus on cost efficiency at the expense of risk management. How C-suites approach key strategic planning choices will be ever more challenging as scale, complexity, and enabling technologies such as AI evolve, not to mention geopolitical, climate, economic, and consumer developments.\n\nThinking in terms of ‘world states’\n\nReglobalization is going to be turbulent and non-linear in its progression. When working with executives, we encourage the development of a mutually exclusive, completely exhaustive (MECE) set of scenarios on a spectrum that ranges from everyone all over the world holding hands to a major regional war. The more probable scenarios are in the middle. In developing the scenarios, three or four realistic ones are sufficient.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/05/world-reglobalizing-multinationals-business-us-china-geopolitics-tariffs-trade-leadership/\n\nSource 7:\nSuch interconnectedness that blurs the lines separating nations, complicates the whole idea of imposing sanctions on one nation or another. As a result, Smith is skeptical that the tariffs imposed on imports by both Biden and Trump before him will resolve the geopolitical tension. To support his skepticism, he cites research <https://www.ft.com/content/497ca6af-1565-443a-ad18-3e9180d04d5e> by the Financial Times that he says shows tariffs slow trade for everyone. Instead, he thinks properly recognizing the interconnectedness of global markets might lead to more measured solutions.\n\n“Everybody looks at China as a monolithic entity," he said. "There\'s a business class in China that doesn\'t want to be wiped out either, as China has become more protectionist. And if you go into a FedEx hub today, you\'ll be amazed at the choreography of stuff going from every part in the world to every other part in the world.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/17/fedex-founder-says-corporate-data-predicted-the-rise-of-tesla-and-nvidiaand-can-flag-new-trends/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/17/fedex-founder-says-corporate-data-predicted-the-rise-of-tesla-and-nvidiaand-can-flag-new-trends/\n\nSource 8:\nNo way out?\n\nCapgemini’s Ezzat told Fortune the many companies considering "friendshoring" in the last decade, as the geopolitical landscape turned increasingly frosty, have found themselves faced with a series of obstacles. \n\n“You have a geopolitical situation where people realize the world is not completely open, which means you have to manage that risk, in terms of how you manage your global supply chain, your sourcing, your exchanges,” Ezzat said.\n\nThe cost of enhanced supply chain security is likely to be economic inefficiencies. A worst-case scenario could put that cost into the trillions.\n\nGita Gopinath, first managing deputy director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that a potential “Cold War II” could wipe $7 trillion <https://fortune.com/europe/2023/12/12/cold-war-two-imf-deputy-gita-gopinath-wipe-trillions-dollars-from-global-economy/> of dollars from global GDP as a result of trade wars.\n\nStill, while Ezzat agrees there are economic costs to nearshoring, he and Capgemini regard it as advantageous over the long term.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/01/21/europe-global-chip-dependency-tech-consulting-capgemini/\n\nSource 9:\nBitcoin as neutral solution\n\nAs anyone who has used Venmo or Zelle can attest, moving money within the U.S. is free and easy.

Nevertheless, businessmen are behaving as if national borders had already disappeared. They are merging and consolidating, forming joint ventures, and setting up bases to assault new markets. The resulting upheaval must be what Jean Monnet, prophet of European union, had in mind when he predicted that the Common Market would touch off "a second industrial revolution." Like any revolution, this one has plenty of confusion, uncertainty, and casualties. As patterns of competition change and artificially protected preserves are opened up, weak firms must seek shelter or get trampled upon and strong ones cannot take their strength for granted. Yet everyone seems to be looking forward with gusto to the test. A few businessmen expressed concern about what the Common Market might do to their immediate prospects, but none even hinted that he would like to see the process stopped or reversed. The business community that started out with the best reasons to be frightened now embraces the new adventure with the most enthusiasm. A few years ago France looked like the weak sister of Europe. Its politics were in disorder, its morale depressed by the impasse in Algeria. Moreover, its notoriously inefficient industry, fragmented into old, tariff-protected family firms, seemed\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/old-europes-young-again-and-fretting-fortune-classics-1963/\n\nSource 2:\nAs a result of these shifts, the digital world has never been more fragmented. But we are not here to argue that all digital barriers must come down. As researchers from academic institutions in the U.S. (Harvard), Europe (INSEAD), and China (Tsinghua), and from a global company (Boston Consulting Group), we recognize that governments will continue to feel an obligation to protect their national security interests and citizens’ data. If anything, we may see more barriers erected in the years to come. But we shouldn’t—in fact, we can’t—give up on cross-border data sharing.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/ai-artificial-intelligence-cross-border-data-sharing/\n\nSource 2:\nRecent events have illustrated the positive impact of sharing—not only within industries (as we have recently argued <https://fortune.com/2024/05/03/potential-unleashed-data-sharing-bcg/>) but also across borders. For example, it took Mayo Clinic <https://fortune.com/company/mayo-clinic/> researchers in the United States just six weeks <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00147-9/fulltext> to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases. This experience, though enabled by the exceptional circumstance of a global pandemic <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-023-00773-0>, is still illustrative of the power of sharing. But if the rise in data regulation continues at its current rate, such cross-border data sharing will become more and more difficult. This would have major implications, both on the global economy and on our collective ability to address issues that can only be solved by using data from multiple countries, such as anticipating natural disasters\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/ai-artificial-intelligence-cross-border-data-sharing/\n\nSource 2:\nWhether preparing for the next pandemic or monitoring the safety of generative AI, policymakers, business leaders, and academics need access to data from both within and outside their national borders. But instead of policies that enable data to flow more freely, constraints have become the norm. Globally, data flow restrictions more than doubled between 2017 and 2021 <https://itif.org/publications/2021/07/19/how-barriers-cross-border-data-flows-are-spreading-globally-what-they-cost/>. Late last year, the U.S. withdrew its long-standing request for the WTO <https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-drops-digital-trade-demands-wto-allow-room-stronger-tech-regulation-2023-10-25/> to prohibit data localization requirements for e-commerce. This is a highly symbolic move from a country that has traditionally been one of the staunchest supporters of tearing down barriers in the digital world.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/ai-artificial-intelligence-cross-border-data-sharing/\n\nSource 3:\nTo make this possible, we expect to see corporate structures move from a hub-and-spoke model to a web model, shaped by demand for local knowledge, relationships, data privacy rules, local content and compliance demands, and the ever-shortening viable time to market. For blocs that align more closely (such as North America and the EU), alignment solutions will be found, whereas competing blocs (such as North America and China) will struggle to find a stable solution for the range of interactions that are either unavoidable or commercially compelling.\n\nPotential high-growth emerging economies will have leverage in pursuing their national interests by maintaining an unaligned position with respect to the strategic competition between China and the U.S. The current oil market exemplifies this dynamic in the interplay between allowed and sanctioned trade.\n\nThis will result in clusters of expertise and supporting supply chain infrastructure appearing in multiple countries, with virtual teams supplanting physically co-located teams.\n\nClusters add robustness and redundancy—but they also make it harder to exclude rivals from the global system. It is unclear whether the existing international organizations that support rules-based behaviors and effective dispute resolution will recover their importance and effectiveness.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/us-china-competition-benefiting-worldand-global-economy-supply-chains-politics-leadership/\n\nSource 4:\nThe critical takeaway is that we need to consider scenarios for the 2030s <https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/geopolitical-risk-rising-how-ceos-prepare>—a time horizon beyond the typical two-to-three-year corporate planning cycle, but not so distant that the scenarios are too theoretical or academic to be useful.\n\nHow geopolitics could reshape the world by 2032\n\nThe least likely scenario today—because of stagnant WTO reforms, the UN’s inability to stop conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, and the rise of protectionist industrial policies <>— <>is a return to the days of global cooperation and peace. Western-values-based global institutions and peace mechanisms would regain dominance, and as sanctions and conflicts recede, global trade would reach historic highs.\n\nA more likely scenario envisions the proliferation of regional conflicts. Although total global trade would be stable, regionalization would shift its flows, and supply shocks would multiply. These disruptions would strain commodity markets, while sanctions complicate capital flows. Global talent flows would also be obstructed.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/07/geopolitics-4-potential-scenarios-map-world-trade-goods-next-decade-bcg-politics/\n\nSource 5:\nGood morning,\n\nFor most Fortune 500 CEOs, globalization is a given. Their challenge is figuring out how to navigate geopolitics while conducting business in a connected world. We convened two dozen members of the Fortune CEO Initiative yesterday for a candid conversation with Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer, who consults with leaders worldwide. Here are a few of his comments:\n\nOn China: “Along with neither side wanting escalating tensions, the Americans and Chinese are increasingly dominant in different and complementary technologies. The Chinese, on everything around the post-carbon transition—not just EVs and batteries and the critical mineral supply chain, but also solar and wind and nuclear at scale. The Americans, on the other hand, [are] increasingly dominant in AI, large language models and frontier models, and the funding for that.”\n\n“If the Chinese want to regulate to ensure that their own population doesn\'t have access to good AI models and the Americans want to regulate to ensure that American citizens have to drive crappy, expensive EVs, we\'re both capable of doing that. But the rest of the world isn\'t going to do that and that is going to be a driver of more intellectual capital and capital and goods and services moving across borders all over the world.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/ian-bremmer-gaza-ukraine-wars-markets-eurasia-group/\n\nSource 6:\nLarge global businesses are not passive or reactive players in the emerging reglobalized world.

As stated in Source 1, "businessmen are behaving as if national borders had already disappeared" [1], indicating that the removal of borders would allow for a more seamless flow of goods and services across the globe. This, in turn, would lead to increased competition, innovation, and economic growth.

The removal of borders would also facilitate the free flow of data, ideas, and people across the globe. As mentioned in Source 2, "cross-border data sharing" would become more prevalent, allowing for greater collaboration and innovation [2]. Additionally, the free movement of people would lead to a more diverse and skilled workforce, as individuals would be able to move freely to pursue opportunities and contribute their skills and expertise to different regions. This is supported by Source 5, which notes that "the Americans and Chinese are increasingly dominant in different and complementary technologies" [5], suggesting that the free flow of people and ideas would lead to greater technological advancements.

However, the removal of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data privacy, and the potential for exploitation. As mentioned in Source 2, "governments will continue to feel an obligation to protect their national security interests and citizens' data" [2]. Furthermore, the lack of borders would require new systems and regulations to be put in place to ensure that the free flow of goods, services, and people is managed in a way that is fair, equitable, and secure

As stated in Source 1, "businessmen are behaving as if national borders had already disappeared" [1], indicating that the removal of borders would allow for a more seamless flow of goods and services across the globe. This, in turn, would lead to increased competition, innovation, and economic growth.

The removal of borders would also facilitate the free flow of data, ideas, and people across the globe. As mentioned in Source 2, "cross-border data sharing" would become more prevalent, allowing for greater collaboration and innovation [2]. Additionally, the free movement of people would lead to a more diverse and skilled workforce, as individuals would be able to move freely to pursue opportunities and contribute their skills and expertise to different regions. This is supported by Source 5, which notes that "the Americans and Chinese are increasingly dominant in different and complementary technologies" [5], suggesting that the free flow of people and ideas would lead to greater technological advancements.

However, the removal of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data privacy, and the potential for exploitation. As mentioned in Source 2, "governments will continue to feel an obligation to protect their national security interests and citizens' data" [2]. Furthermore, the lack of borders would require new systems and regulations to be put in place to ensure that the free flow of goods, services, and people is managed in a way that is fair, equitable, and secure.

As stated in Source 1, "businessmen are behaving as if national borders had already disappeared" [1], indicating that the removal of borders would allow for a more seamless flow of goods and services across the globe. This, in turn, would lead to increased competition, innovation, and economic growth.

The removal of borders would also facilitate the free flow of data, ideas, and people across the globe. As mentioned in Source 2, "cross-border data sharing" would become more prevalent, allowing for greater collaboration and innovation [2]. Additionally, the free movement of people would lead to a more diverse and skilled workforce, as individuals would be able to move freely to pursue opportunities and contribute their skills and expertise to different regions. This is supported by Source 5, which notes that "the Americans and Chinese are increasingly dominant in different and complementary technologies" [5], suggesting that the free flow of people and ideas would lead to greater technological advancements.

However, the removal of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data privacy, and the potential for exploitation. As mentioned in Source 2, "governments will continue to feel an obligation to protect their national security interests and citizens' data" [2]. Furthermore, the lack of borders would require new systems and regulations to be put in place to ensure that the free flow of goods, services, and people is managed in a way that is fair, equitable, and secure. This is supported by Source 6, which notes that "reglobalization is going to be turbulent and non-linear in its progression" [6], suggesting that the removal of borders would require careful planning and management to ensure a smooth transition.
