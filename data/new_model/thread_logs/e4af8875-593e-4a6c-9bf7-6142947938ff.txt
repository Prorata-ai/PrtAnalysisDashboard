Still, during the eight-week fake meat diet, most people lost weight and saw a drop in their LDL (“bad”) cholesterol. \n\nBut more recent studies haven’t been so positive.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/is-plant-based-meat-healthy/\n\nSource 1:\nWhen you go out for a burger <https://fortune.com/well/2023/08/05/healthy-fast-food-picks/>, you face a lot of choices: Fries or onion rings, bun or lettuce wrap, beef patty or veggie burger? Veggie, of course! That’s the healthier choice, right? \n\nNot so fast.\n\nBecause while there’s a vegan alternative to just about any meat product from beef burgers and chicken nuggets to hot dogs and breakfast sausages, the nutritional content may not be quite what you were hoping for. \n\n“People think that if it’s plant-based <https://fortune.com/well/2023/05/24/plant-based-diet-benefits/>, it’s healthy or healthier, and that certainly can be, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be,” says D. Julian McClements, PhD, a distinguished professor of food science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, whose research focuses on plant-based foods. “It really depends on [if] the company [is] designing it correctly.” \n\nWhat\'s in plant-based meat?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/is-plant-based-meat-healthy/\n\nSource 1:\nBut more recent studies haven’t been so positive. \n\nA 2024 study <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916524003964> took the same eight-week approach. Only this time, it included 82 people. Half ate from a predetermined menu of meats the whole time. The other half ate the veggie version of each of those meats from various brands, including Impossible, Beyond, and others. The researchers checked everyone’s weight, cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure, and other health markers at the beginning and the end. \n\nThe people in the plant-based group didn’t come out any better in the end than their meat-eating counterparts. \n\nBut coming out “better” is not exactly the point of these burger lookalikes, says Sunil Chandran, Chief Scientific Officer at Impossible Foods.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/is-plant-based-meat-healthy/\n\nSource 1:\nFuture impact\n\nBut plant-based meat substitutes still do measurable good. Their manufacture uses less water and land, causes less water and air pollution, and produces fewer greenhouse gasses than meat production. They have about half the environmental impact <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9936781/> of real meat. \n\n“Animal production cannot sustain the world’s population or the world climate,” Xiong says. “But plants we can grow, so sustainability is a driving force of this market.” \n\nAs the plant-based protein market continues to grow, and processing advances, experts expect you’ll have healthier choices, too. \n\n“In the past, food scientists designed foods to be delicious, convenient, and affordable,” McClements says. “But this next generation of plant-based foods is where we’re trying to design health and sustainability as well.”\n\nMore on plant-based foods and nutrition:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/is-plant-based-meat-healthy/\n\nSource 1:\nIs plant-based meat ultra-processed? \n\nThe more closely meat alternatives mimic real meat, the more processed they likely are. And that’s where you might run into problems. \n\nFor starters, ultra-processing can rob otherwise good-for-you foods of their nutritional value. When whole foods are broken down and forced into other forms—whether it’s a corn chip or a soy patty—a lot of their natural fiber <https://fortune.com/well/2023/05/27/fiber-health-benefits/> is lost, according to the American Medical Association <https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-ultraprocessed-foods>. Lower-fiber foods digest more quickly, which causes a blood sugar spike and also doesn’t leave you feeling as satisfied as whole, unprocessed foods do. That’s ok for a treat now and then. But diets high in ultra-processed foods can lead to overeating, obesity, and diabetes. \n\nThat’s the problem with any ultra-processed food. Fake meats in particular can have other problems.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/is-plant-based-meat-healthy/\n\nSource 1:\nA small 2022 study <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9554424/> in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition says no. In it, the same 36 adults from the 2020 study showed very little difference in inflammation levels after eight weeks on alt meats and eight weeks on beef. \n\nThe good news is: You have choices. If health is a concern, you have to look beyond the “plant-based” branding and read the label. Go for the options with more fiber and less sugar, fat and sodium. \n\nBeyond Meat recently announced that they’ve reformulated their burger and ground beef alternatives to replace coconut and canola oils with avocado oil, bringing the saturated fat content down by 60% to just 2 grams per serving. The new formulation, scheduled to arrive in supermarkets in June, also cuts sodium by 20%. \n\n“It’s important to note that our products are similar to or lower in sodium than plain ground beef once you add salt or a seasoning blend [to plain ground beef], which most people do during the cooking process,” says Joy Bauer, RDN, nutrition advisor to Beyond Meat.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/is-plant-based-meat-healthy/\n\nSource 2:\nSo why is Beyond Meat releasing such a product line? \n\n“If the Achilles heel for meat was that it didn’t taste good enough, I’d be all over it,” Ethan Brown, the founder and CEO of Beyond Meat, told me. “But it’s not. The Achilles heel for meat is its negative implications on human health, so I’m going to go after that with everything I have with products that taste great. But the thing we won’t win on in my view is let’s just load something up with saturated fat, just make it taste exactly like it. I know enough about life and I’ve been doing this long enough that when I offer people a side-by-side choice and there’s no benefit to consuming the plant-based version and there’s questions about what it’s made from, you don’t win.”\n\nI am a huge fan of Brown and am sympathetic to his viewpoint. However, I think there are some flaws in his logic.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/10/beyond-meat-wants-healthier-ceo-ethan-brown-seems-hack-impossible-trade-off-nutrition-taste/\n\nSource 2:\nThis in part explains why the market had a boom at first, but has slumped <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-01-19/beyond-meat-bynd-impossible-foods-burgers-are-just-another-food-fad> since.

They’re packed with identifiable veggies like spinach and lentils, and are part of the company’s greater efforts—and a growing trend in the market—to put out healthier products.\n\nWhile that might sound positive, I see it as a major cause for concern. Beyond Meat is moving away from what made its products so different from—and much more successful than—prior generations of plant-based meat.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/10/beyond-meat-wants-healthier-ceo-ethan-brown-seems-hack-impossible-trade-off-nutrition-taste/\n\nSource 2:\nThis trend of making plant-based meat healthier is especially problematic given that the products on the market today still don’t taste good enough.

Just beware, they don\'t promise to save you any calories and, surprisingly, may contain even more fat.\n\nWhat does the science say about plant-based meat?\n\nScientific research gives faux meat mixed reviews.\nScientific research gives faux meat mixed reviews. \n\nIn a small November 2020 study  <https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(22)00890-5/fulltext>in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers tracked a group of 36 adults for 16 weeks. For eight weeks, they had two servings of meat per day, such as pork, hamburgers, sausage and ground beef. For the other eight weeks, they had two daily servings of the Beyond brand counterpart instead of meat. Half the group did the meat diet first; the other half went veg first. Then they switched. Everything else stayed the same over the four months, including daily exercise and overall calorie intake. Still, during the eight-week fake meat diet, most people lost weight and saw a drop in their LDL (“bad”) cholesterol. \n\nBut more recent studies haven’t been so positive.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/is-plant-based-meat-healthy/\n\nSource 1:\nWhen you go out for a burger <https://fortune.com/well/2023/08/05/healthy-fast-food-picks/>, you face a lot of choices: Fries or onion rings, bun or lettuce wrap, beef patty or veggie burger? Veggie, of course! That’s the healthier choice, right? \n\nNot so fast.\n\nBecause while there’s a vegan alternative to just about any meat product from beef burgers and chicken nuggets to hot dogs and breakfast sausages, the nutritional content may not be quite what you were hoping for. \n\n“People think that if it’s plant-based <https://fortune.com/well/2023/05/24/plant-based-diet-benefits/>, it’s healthy or healthier, and that certainly can be, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be,” says D. Julian McClements, PhD, a distinguished professor of food science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, whose research focuses on plant-based foods. “It really depends on [if] the company [is] designing it correctly.” \n\nWhat\'s in plant-based meat?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/is-plant-based-meat-healthy/\n\nSource 1:\nBut more recent studies haven’t been so positive. \n\nA 2024 study <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916524003964> took the same eight-week approach. Only this time, it included 82 people. Half ate from a predetermined menu of meats the whole time. The other half ate the veggie version of each of those meats from various brands, including Impossible, Beyond, and others. The researchers checked everyone’s weight, cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure, and other health markers at the beginning and the end. \n\nThe people in the plant-based group didn’t come out any better in the end than their meat-eating counterparts. \n\nBut coming out “better” is not exactly the point of these burger lookalikes, says Sunil Chandran, Chief Scientific Officer at Impossible Foods.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/is-plant-based-meat-healthy/\n\nSource 1:\nFuture impact\n\nBut plant-based meat substitutes still do measurable good. Their manufacture uses less water and land, causes less water and air pollution, and produces fewer greenhouse gasses than meat production. They have about half the environmental impact <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9936781/> of real meat. \n\n“Animal production cannot sustain the world’s population or the world climate,” Xiong says. “But plants we can grow, so sustainability is a driving force of this market.” \n\nAs the plant-based protein market continues to grow, and processing advances, experts expect you’ll have healthier choices, too. \n\n“In the past, food scientists designed foods to be delicious, convenient, and affordable,” McClements says. “But this next generation of plant-based foods is where we’re trying to design health and sustainability as well.”\n\nMore on plant-based foods and nutrition:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/is-plant-based-meat-healthy/\n\nSource 1:\nIs plant-based meat ultra-processed? \n\nThe more closely meat alternatives mimic real meat, the more processed they likely are. And that’s where you might run into problems. \n\nFor starters, ultra-processing can rob otherwise good-for-you foods of their nutritional value. When whole foods are broken down and forced into other forms—whether it’s a corn chip or a soy patty—a lot of their natural fiber <https://fortune.com/well/2023/05/27/fiber-health-benefits/> is lost, according to the American Medical Association <https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-ultraprocessed-foods>. Lower-fiber foods digest more quickly, which causes a blood sugar spike and also doesn’t leave you feeling as satisfied as whole, unprocessed foods do. That’s ok for a treat now and then. But diets high in ultra-processed foods can lead to overeating, obesity, and diabetes. \n\nThat’s the problem with any ultra-processed food. Fake meats in particular can have other problems.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/is-plant-based-meat-healthy/\n\nSource 1:\nA small 2022 study <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9554424/> in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition says no. In it, the same 36 adults from the 2020 study showed very little difference in inflammation levels after eight weeks on alt meats and eight weeks on beef. \n\nThe good news is: You have choices. If health is a concern, you have to look beyond the “plant-based” branding and read the label. Go for the options with more fiber and less sugar, fat and sodium. \n\nBeyond Meat recently announced that they’ve reformulated their burger and ground beef alternatives to replace coconut and canola oils with avocado oil, bringing the saturated fat content down by 60% to just 2 grams per serving. The new formulation, scheduled to arrive in supermarkets in June, also cuts sodium by 20%. \n\n“It’s important to note that our products are similar to or lower in sodium than plain ground beef once you add salt or a seasoning blend [to plain ground beef], which most people do during the cooking process,” says Joy Bauer, RDN, nutrition advisor to Beyond Meat.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/is-plant-based-meat-healthy/\n\nSource 2:\nSo why is Beyond Meat releasing such a product line? \n\n“If the Achilles heel for meat was that it didn’t taste good enough, I’d be all over it,” Ethan Brown, the founder and CEO of Beyond Meat, told me. “But it’s not. The Achilles heel for meat is its negative implications on human health, so I’m going to go after that with everything I have with products that taste great. But the thing we won’t win on in my view is let’s just load something up with saturated fat, just make it taste exactly like it. I know enough about life and I’ve been doing this long enough that when I offer people a side-by-side choice and there’s no benefit to consuming the plant-based version and there’s questions about what it’s made from, you don’t win.”\n\nI am a huge fan of Brown and am sympathetic to his viewpoint. However, I think there are some flaws in his logic.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/10/beyond-meat-wants-healthier-ceo-ethan-brown-seems-hack-impossible-trade-off-nutrition-taste/\n\nSource 2:\nThis in part explains why the market had a boom at first, but has slumped <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-01-19/beyond-meat-bynd-impossible-foods-burgers-are-just-another-food-fad> since.

And yet, that’s exactly what alternative protein company Beyond <https://fortune.com/company/overstock-com/> Meat is offering <https://www.fastcompany.com/91160776/beyond-meats-newest-sausages-vegetables-fruits-legumes> with its latest product, the Sun Sausage. Unlike their flagship burger, the sausages aren’t meant to simulate the taste or texture of animal meat. They’re packed with identifiable veggies like spinach and lentils, and are part of the company’s greater efforts—and a growing trend in the market—to put out healthier products.\n\nWhile that might sound positive, I see it as a major cause for concern. Beyond Meat is moving away from what made its products so different from—and much more successful than—prior generations of plant-based meat.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/10/beyond-meat-wants-healthier-ceo-ethan-brown-seems-hack-impossible-trade-off-nutrition-taste/\n\nSource 2:\nThis trend of making plant-based meat healthier is especially problematic given that the products on the market today still don’t taste good enough. Research <https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/nectar-taste-of-the-industry-plant-based-meat-blended-report/> published in June based on insights from 1,150 American meat-eaters who participated in sensory panels evaluating 15 taste attributes for 54 plant-based meat products across five categories found that most plant-based meats don’t even begin to compare to regular meat as far as flavor is concerned. The findings were clear: People want plant-based burgers to be “meatier,” which they define as spicier, smokier, saltier, sweeter, darker, and juicier.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/10/beyond-meat-wants-healthier-ceo-ethan-brown-seems-hack-impossible-trade-off-nutrition-taste/'}

The findings were clear: People want plant-based burgers to be “meatier,” which they define as spicier, smokier, saltier, sweeter, darker, and juicier.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/10/beyond-meat-wants-healthier-ceo-ethan-brown-seems-hack-impossible-trade-off-nutrition-taste/'}

2024-11-07 23:15:32,472: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: A plant-based diet has been shown to have numerous benefits for overall health and well-being. According to a study, a plant-based diet can lower the risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, depression, and some cancers [1]. Additionally, a plant-based diet can also help with weight loss and improve LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels [3]. Furthermore, a diet rich in plants can strengthen gut health by increasing the diversity of gut microbiota [4].

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to consider. One of the main concerns is the potential lack of essential nutrients, such as protein, iron, and vitamin B12, which are commonly found in animal products. Moreover, some plant-based meat alternatives may be highly processed and contain high amounts of sodium, sugar, and fat [2]. These ultra-processed foods can lead to overeating, obesity, and diabetes [5]. It is essential to opt for whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible and read labels carefully to make informed choices.

2024-11-07 23:15:32,645: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: A plant-based diet has been shown to have numerous benefits for overall health and well-being. According to a study, a plant-based diet can lower the risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, depression, and some cancers [1]. Additionally, a plant-based diet can also help with weight loss and improve LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels [3]. Furthermore, a diet rich in plants can strengthen gut health by increasing the diversity of gut microbiota [4].

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to consider. One of the main concerns is the potential lack of essential nutrients, such as protein, iron, and vitamin B12, which are commonly found in animal products. Moreover, some plant-based meat alternatives may be highly processed and contain high amounts of sodium, sugar, and fat [2]. These ultra-processed foods can lead to overeating, obesity, and diabetes [5]. It is essential to opt for whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible and read labels carefully to make informed choices.

In terms of plant-based meat alternatives, there is ongoing debate about their health benefits. While some studies suggest that they can be a healthier option than traditional meat, others have found no significant difference in health outcomes [3, 6]. The manufacturing

2024-11-07 23:15:32,817: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: A plant-based diet has been shown to have numerous benefits for overall health and well-being. According to a study, a plant-based diet can lower the risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, depression, and some cancers [1]. Additionally, a plant-based diet can also help with weight loss and improve LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels [3]. Furthermore, a diet rich in plants can strengthen gut health by increasing the diversity of gut microbiota [4].

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to consider. One of the main concerns is the potential lack of essential nutrients, such as protein, iron, and vitamin B12, which are commonly found in animal products. Moreover, some plant-based meat alternatives may be highly processed and contain high amounts of sodium, sugar, and fat [2]. These ultra-processed foods can lead to overeating, obesity, and diabetes [5]. It is essential to opt for whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible and read labels carefully to make informed choices.

In terms of plant-based meat alternatives, there is ongoing debate about their health benefits. While some studies suggest that they can be a healthier option than traditional meat, others have found no significant difference in health outcomes [3, 6]. The manufacturing process and ingredients used in these products can also raise concerns about their environmental impact and potential health effects [2

2024-11-07 23:15:32,933: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: A plant-based diet has been shown to have numerous benefits for overall health and well-being. According to a study, a plant-based diet can lower the risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, depression, and some cancers [1]. Additionally, a plant-based diet can also help with weight loss and improve LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels [3]. Furthermore, a diet rich in plants can strengthen gut health by increasing the diversity of gut microbiota [4].

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to consider. One of the main concerns is the potential lack of essential nutrients, such as protein, iron, and vitamin B12, which are commonly found in animal products. Moreover, some plant-based meat alternatives may be highly processed and contain high amounts of sodium, sugar, and fat [2]. These ultra-processed foods can lead to overeating, obesity, and diabetes [5]. It is essential to opt for whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible and read labels carefully to make informed choices.

In terms of plant-based meat alternatives, there is ongoing debate about their health benefits. While some studies suggest that they can be a healthier option than traditional meat, others have found no significant difference in health outcomes [3, 6]. The manufacturing process and ingredients used in these products can also raise concerns about their environmental impact and potential health effects [2].

Furthermore, a diet rich in plants can strengthen gut health by increasing the diversity of gut microbiota [4].

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to consider. One of the main concerns is the potential lack of essential nutrients, such as protein, iron, and vitamin B12, which are commonly found in animal products. Moreover, some plant-based meat alternatives may be highly processed and contain high amounts of sodium, sugar, and fat [2]. These ultra-processed foods can lead to overeating, obesity, and diabetes [5]. It is essential to opt for whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible and read labels carefully to make informed choices.

In terms of plant-based meat alternatives, there is ongoing debate about their health benefits. While some studies suggest that they can be a healthier option than traditional meat, others have found no significant difference in health outcomes [3, 6]. The manufacturing process and ingredients used in these products can also raise concerns about their environmental impact and potential health effects [2]. Ultimately, a well-planned plant-based diet that emphasizes whole, nutrient-dense foods can provide numerous health benefits, but it is crucial to be aware of the potential drawbacks and make informed choices.

Moreover, some plant-based meat alternatives may be highly processed and contain high amounts of sodium, sugar, and fat [2]. These ultra-processed foods can lead to overeating, obesity, and diabetes [5]. It is essential to opt for whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible and read labels carefully to make informed choices.

In terms of plant-based meat alternatives, there is ongoing debate about their health benefits. While some studies suggest that they can be a healthier option than traditional meat, others have found no significant difference in health outcomes [3, 6]. The manufacturing process and ingredients used in these products can also raise concerns about their environmental impact and potential health effects [2]. Ultimately, a well-planned plant-based diet that emphasizes whole, nutrient-dense foods can provide numerous health benefits, but it is crucial to be aware of the potential drawbacks and make informed choices.

2024-11-07 23:15:33,074: ObserveEventsHandler(  207): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd response: assistant: A plant-based diet has been shown to have numerous benefits for overall health and well-being. According to a study, a plant-based diet can lower the risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, depression, and some cancers [1]. Additionally, a plant-based diet can also help with weight loss and improve LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels [3]. Furthermore, a diet rich in plants can strengthen gut health by increasing the diversity of gut microbiota [4].
