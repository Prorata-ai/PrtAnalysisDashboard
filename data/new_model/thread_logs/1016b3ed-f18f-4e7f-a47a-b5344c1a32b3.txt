When 2000 rolled around, we were working every bit as hard as in the 1960s, and far more of us were working—48% of the population versus 38%. Even so, the economy wasn’t even as big as its minimum projected size in The Year 2000. What went wrong is no mystery. The forecasters extrapolated the previous 20 years of labor productivity growth into the future, but in fact productivity growth slumped deeply. The “productivity paradox” continues and still isn’t well understood, but the lesson is clear: Extrapolating any trend decades into the future is asking for trouble.\n\nSo the Bright Future view of 2000 was wrong—but thankfully the Dark Future view that emerged around 1980 was even further off.

Just weeks ago the phrase was a history book curiosity that seemingly had no meaning in the modern age. No more. Stock markets around the world have just gone through a classic panic, unique in its high-tech mechanics and the magnitude of the price collapse but no different in substance or dynamics from those of 1929 and 1907. What set it off? Pundits, politicians, and professional investors cite an array of causes. The failure of Congress and the Administration to deal adequately with the federal budget deficit. The stubbornly high U.S. trade deficit. Deepening crisis in the Middle East. Treasury Secretary James Baker's threat to force the dollar down sharply against the German mark. The pernicious influence of so-called program traders on Wall Street. Proposed tax legislation that could bring corporate takeovers, and even friendly acquisitions, to a dead halt. Tight monetary policy that left the markets starved for liquidity and helped push interest rates on government bonds above 10%. Many of those surely affected the market.

Stock markets around the world have just gone through a classic panic, unique in its high-tech mechanics and the magnitude of the price collapse but no different in substance or dynamics from those of 1929 and 1907. What set it off? Pundits, politicians, and professional investors cite an array of causes. The failure of Congress and the Administration to deal adequately with the federal budget deficit. The stubbornly high U.S. trade deficit. Deepening crisis in the Middle East. Treasury Secretary James Baker's threat to force the dollar down sharply against the German mark. The pernicious influence of so-called program traders on Wall Street. Proposed tax legislation that could bring corporate takeovers, and even friendly acquisitions, to a dead halt. Tight monetary policy that left the markets starved for liquidity and helped push interest rates on government bonds above 10%. Many of those surely affected the market.

The stubbornly high U.S. trade deficit. Deepening crisis in the Middle East. Treasury Secretary James Baker's threat to force the dollar down sharply against the German mark. The pernicious influence of so-called program traders on Wall Street. Proposed tax legislation that could bring corporate takeovers, and even friendly acquisitions, to a dead halt.

The stubbornly high U.S. trade deficit. Deepening crisis in the Middle East. Treasury Secretary James Baker's threat to force the dollar down sharply against the German mark. The pernicious influence of so-called program traders on Wall Street. Proposed tax legislation that could bring corporate takeovers, and even friendly acquisitions, to a dead halt.

When 2000 rolled around, we were working every bit as hard as in the 1960s, and far more of us were working—48% of the population versus 38%. Even so, the economy wasn’t even as big as its minimum projected size in The Year 2000. What went wrong is no mystery. The forecasters extrapolated the previous 20 years of labor productivity growth into the future, but in fact productivity growth slumped deeply. The “productivity paradox” continues and still isn’t well understood, but the lesson is clear: Extrapolating any trend decades into the future is asking for trouble.\n\nSo the Bright Future view of 2000 was wrong—but thankfully the Dark Future view that emerged around 1980 was even further off. That view was summarized in a U.S. government report titled Global 2000. With utter confidence it predicted a colder, hungrier, poorer world of poisoned seas and food wars in the streets. The mortal threat to the planet would be global cooling, not global warming, and America would have to quell food riots, not an obesity epidemic.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/27/ai-jobs-elon-musk-vonod-khosla-permanent-vacation/\n\nSource 2:\nEditor\'s note: This article from the November 23, 1987 issue of Fortune was published right after that year\'s stock crash.\n<https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/stock_crash_chicago_la1.jpg> FINANCIAL PANIC. Just weeks ago the phrase was a history book curiosity that seemingly had no meaning in the modern age. No more. Stock markets around the world have just gone through a classic panic, unique in its high-tech mechanics and the magnitude of the price collapse but no different in substance or dynamics from those of 1929 and 1907. What set it off? Pundits, politicians, and professional investors cite an array of causes. The failure of Congress and the Administration to deal adequately with the federal budget deficit. The stubbornly high U.S. trade deficit. Deepening crisis in the Middle East. Treasury Secretary James Baker\'s threat to force the dollar down sharply against the German mark. The pernicious influence of so-called program traders on Wall Street. Proposed tax legislation that could bring corporate takeovers, and even friendly acquisitions, to a dead halt. Tight monetary policy that left the markets starved for liquidity and helped push interest rates on government bonds above 10%. Many of those surely affected the market. But the world will never really know why panic suddenly ruled, why the Dow\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-great-crash-what-happened-and-whats-next-fortune-1987/\n\nSource 3:\nThis article appeared in the April 11, 1988 issue of Fortune.\n\nWarren Buffett <http://fortune.com/2017/08/30/warren-buffett-birthday/>, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway <https://fortune.com/company/berkshire-hathaway/>, calls the conglomerate his "canvas," and shortly, when its annual report comes out, the world will learn precisely what kind of picture this legendary investor painted in the tumultuous year of 1987. A preview: As a work of art, the year was not a minor Buffett. Berkshire—whose shareholders, I wish to say quickly and happily, have long included me—chalked up a $464 million gain in net worth, an advance of no less than 19.5%. That is somewhat below the 23.1% annual average that Buffett has recorded since taking over the company 23 years ago. But in a year in which many professional investors had their heads handed to them, this latest example of Buffett brushwork has to rank as one more masterpiece.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/warren-buffett-inside-story/\n\nSource 4:\nBut this was the scene we all prepared for IRL on New Year\'s Eve 24 years ago, as the clocks on our computers struck midnight, and the last two digits of the year 1999 went back to zero to mark the start of a new millennium. If you think back to the Y2K prep days, the scenarios envisioned were very much like what happened today. \n\n“The Year 2000 problem could result in a stunning array of technological failures. Air traffic could be delayed or even grounded; telephone service could be interrupted; breakdowns in the production and distribution of electricity could bring widespread power failures; automatic teller machines might malfunction; traffic lights could stop working,” reads a 1998 report <https://www.congress.gov/105/crpt/hrpt827/CRPT-105hrpt827.pdf> by the Congressional Committee on Government Reform and Oversight.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/19/crowdstrike-microsoft-outage-y2k/\n\nSource 5:\nand then they tanked. The left-hand side of the chart, in fact, is filled with aberrations: not only the Depression but also a wartime profits boom--sedated by the excess-profits tax--and another boom after the war. But from 1951 on, the percentage settled down pretty much to a 4% to 6.5% range. By 1981, though, the trend was headed toward the bottom of that band, and in 1982 profits tumbled to 3.5%. So at that point investors were looking at two strong negatives: Profits were sub-par and interest rates were sky-high. And as is so typical, investors projected out into the future what they were seeing. That\'s their unshakable habit: looking into the rear-view mirror instead of through the windshield. What they were observing, looking backward, made them very discouraged about the country. They were projecting high interest rates, they were projecting low profits, and they were therefore valuing the Dow at a level that was the same as 17 years earlier, even though GDP had nearly quintupled. Now, what happened in the 17 years beginning with 1982? One thing that didn\'t happen was comparable growth in GDP:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/warren-buffett-on-stock-market/\n\nSource 5:\ndone in a great many 17-year periods in history--in most 17-year periods, in fact. It was a helluva result, and from none other than a stodgy bond. The power of interest rates had the effect of pushing up equities as well, though other things that we will get to pushed additionally. And so here\'s what equities did in that same 17 years: If you\'d invested $1 million in the Dow on Nov. 16, 1981, and reinvested all dividends, you\'d have had $19,720,112 on Dec. 31, 1998. And your annual return would have been 19%. The increase in equity values since 1981 beats anything you can find in history. This increase even surpasses what you would have realized if you\'d bought stocks in 1932, at their Depression bottom--on its lowest day, July 8, 1932, the Dow closed at 41.22--and held them for 17 years.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/warren-buffett-on-stock-market/\n\nSource 6:\nThen came the 1980s. As banks sought to expand their revenue, Citibank CEO, Walter Wriston declared <https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1301&context=til#:~:text=The%20most%20charismatic%20and%20influential,doesn\'t%20go%20away%2C%20the> that “countries never go bankrupt,” triggering <https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/latin-american-debt-crisis> a surge in lending to risky markets, followed in the early 1990s by the collapse <https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/1116/2008-Is%20Commercial%20Real%20Estate%20Reliving%20the%201980s%20and%20Early%201990s%3F.pdf> of over-developed commercial real estate.

Contrast that with the federal deficit in fiscal year 2023, which topped $1.7 trillion <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSD>, an amount larger than Mexico’s total economy (the 12th largest in the world). It exceeded $1 trillion <https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3035823/interest-national-debt-eats-up-18-percent-tax-revenue/?utm_source=In%20Our%20Opinion%2006122024_06/12/2024&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=WEX_In%20Our%20Opinion&rid=96903&env=f09867920a219fa6f25b370936f249e97bb40976c8b8ece8d238170e0333bc71> again in the first eight months of the current fiscal year and, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s latest forecast, released on June 18, will approach $2 trillion by the end of fiscal 2024.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/24/national-debt-34-trillion-america-government-finances/\n\nSource 8:\nThis catastrophe has been a long time in the making. In 1993, for instance, the annual deficit amounted to 3.8% of GDP, and the debt, which seemed astronomically high at a “mere” $4.4 trillion <https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/historical-debt-outstanding/historical-debt-outstanding>, was Lilliputian by today’s standards.\n\nThe trend goes back longer than that. The growth of the U.S. government in modern times is the story of post-WWII America. President Dwight Eisenhower seems to have been the last guy in the post-WWII era who understood that the welfare state, the warfare state, and tax cuts not backed by tough spending cuts are incompatible with fiscally responsible government, or at least with reasonably-sized government. His predecessor, Harry Truman, who had funded the Korean War effort, left Eisenhower a level of federal spending equivalent to 18.5% of GDP. Between then and now <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYONGDA188S>, both parties, with short-lived exceptions, have pushed both the defense and domestic budgets exponentially higher.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/24/national-debt-34-trillion-america-government-finances/\n\nSource 8:\nThere was a time, even in the middle of the Cold War, when government leaders, despite their international responsibilities and the onerous legacy of the New Deal and Great Society that nobody dared reverse, understood the need for fiscal discipline and containing the growth of government.\n\nBetween 1947 and 1966, the budget was balanced in 12 years, while the rest of the time there was a negligible average deficit of 0.07%. Contrast that with the 12 years under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush (mostly with a hostile or partly hostile Congress), which averaged a 4% deficit due to defense spending increases, abandonment of domestic restraint—a legacy of Johnson’s “bread and butter” years and the Nixon-Ford presidencies’ about-face on most of the economic principles they previously had espoused—and the unfunded tax cuts influenced by Arthur Laffer’s notion that tax cuts would pay for themselves. Gone was Eisenhower’s discipline, who insisted on slashing spending before he cut taxes.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/24/national-debt-34-trillion-america-government-finances/\n\nSource 9:\nStrassman, a lecturer at the National Defense University and an expert in cyberterrorism. Consider: In the autumn of 1997 the Naval War College invited several private-sector participants to take part in a cyberterrorism simulation. It makes for chilling reading today. First, the NWC\'s partner in developing the war game was none other than Cantor Fitzgerald, the bond trading firm devastated by the all too real attack on Sept. 11. Second, it involves a scenario spilling out of conflict in the oil fields of the Middle East that now seems eerily plausible, if not yet entirely likely. That\'s followed by terrorist assaults against oil fields in the Persian Gulf and U.S. military installations, accompanied by a devastating cyberassault on the computer networks of U.S. financial institutions as well as power grids in the New York area--assaults intended to inflict further psychological and economic damage on the U.S. In the simulation the terrorists succeeded spectacularly.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/battered-but-unbroken-fortune-classics-2001/'}

Just weeks ago the phrase was a history book curiosity that seemingly had no meaning in the modern age. No more. Stock markets around the world have just gone through a classic panic, unique in its high-tech mechanics and the magnitude of the price collapse but no different in substance or dynamics from those of 1929 and 1907. What set it off? Pundits, politicians, and professional investors cite an array of causes. The failure of Congress and the Administration to deal adequately with the federal budget deficit. The stubbornly high U.S. trade deficit. Deepening crisis in the Middle East. Treasury Secretary James Baker\'s threat to force the dollar down sharply against the German mark. The pernicious influence of so-called program traders on Wall Street. Proposed tax legislation that could bring corporate takeovers, and even friendly acquisitions, to a dead halt. Tight monetary policy that left the markets starved for liquidity and helped push interest rates on government bonds above 10%. Many of those surely affected the market. But the world will never really know why panic suddenly ruled, why the Dow\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-great-crash-what-happened-and-whats-next-fortune-1987/\n\nSource 3:\nThis article appeared in the April 11, 1988 issue of Fortune.\n\nWarren Buffett <http://fortune.com/2017/08/30/warren-buffett-birthday/>, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway <https://fortune.com/company/berkshire-hathaway/>, calls the conglomerate his "canvas," and shortly, when its annual report comes out, the world will learn precisely what kind of picture this legendary investor painted in the tumultuous year of 1987. A preview: As a work of art, the year was not a minor Buffett. Berkshire—whose shareholders, I wish to say quickly and happily, have long included me—chalked up a $464 million gain in net worth, an advance of no less than 19.5%. That is somewhat below the 23.1% annual average that Buffett has recorded since taking over the company 23 years ago. But in a year in which many professional investors had their heads handed to them, this latest example of Buffett brushwork has to rank as one more masterpiece.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/warren-buffett-inside-story/\n\nSource 4:\nBut this was the scene we all prepared for IRL on New Year\'s Eve 24 years ago, as the clocks on our computers struck midnight, and the last two digits of the year 1999 went back to zero to mark the start of a new millennium. If you think back to the Y2K prep days, the scenarios envisioned were very much like what happened today. \n\n“The Year 2000 problem could result in a stunning array of technological failures. Air traffic could be delayed or even grounded; telephone service could be interrupted; breakdowns in the production and distribution of electricity could bring widespread power failures; automatic teller machines might malfunction; traffic lights could stop working,” reads a 1998 report <https://www.congress.gov/105/crpt/hrpt827/CRPT-105hrpt827.pdf> by the Congressional Committee on Government Reform and Oversight.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/19/crowdstrike-microsoft-outage-y2k/\n\nSource 5:\nand then they tanked. The left-hand side of the chart, in fact, is filled with aberrations: not only the Depression but also a wartime profits boom--sedated by the excess-profits tax--and another boom after the war. But from 1951 on, the percentage settled down pretty much to a 4% to 6.5% range. By 1981, though, the trend was headed toward the bottom of that band, and in 1982 profits tumbled to 3.5%. So at that point investors were looking at two strong negatives: Profits were sub-par and interest rates were sky-high. And as is so typical, investors projected out into the future what they were seeing. That\'s their unshakable habit: looking into the rear-view mirror instead of through the windshield. What they were observing, looking backward, made them very discouraged about the country. They were projecting high interest rates, they were projecting low profits, and they were therefore valuing the Dow at a level that was the same as 17 years earlier, even though GDP had nearly quintupled. Now, what happened in the 17 years beginning with 1982? One thing that didn\'t happen was comparable growth in GDP:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/warren-buffett-on-stock-market/\n\nSource 5:\ndone in a great many 17-year periods in history--in most 17-year periods, in fact. It was a helluva result, and from none other than a stodgy bond. The power of interest rates had the effect of pushing up equities as well, though other things that we will get to pushed additionally. And so here\'s what equities did in that same 17 years: If you\'d invested $1 million in the Dow on Nov. 16, 1981, and reinvested all dividends, you\'d have had $19,720,112 on Dec. 31, 1998. And your annual return would have been 19%. The increase in equity values since 1981 beats anything you can find in history. This increase even surpasses what you would have realized if you\'d bought stocks in 1932, at their Depression bottom--on its lowest day, July 8, 1932, the Dow closed at 41.22--and held them for 17 years.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/warren-buffett-on-stock-market/\n\nSource 6:\nThen came the 1980s. As banks sought to expand their revenue, Citibank CEO, Walter Wriston declared <https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1301&context=til#:~:text=The%20most%20charismatic%20and%20influential,doesn\'t%20go%20away%2C%20the> that “countries never go bankrupt,” triggering <https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/latin-american-debt-crisis> a surge in lending to risky markets, followed in the early 1990s by the collapse <https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/1116/2008-Is%20Commercial%20Real%20Estate%20Reliving%20the%201980s%20and%20Early%201990s%3F.pdf> of over-developed commercial real estate.

The left-hand side of the chart, in fact, is filled with aberrations: not only the Depression but also a wartime profits boom--sedated by the excess-profits tax--and another boom after the war. But from 1951 on, the percentage settled down pretty much to a 4% to 6.5% range. By 1981, though, the trend was headed toward the bottom of that band, and in 1982 profits tumbled to 3.5%. So at that point investors were looking at two strong negatives: Profits were sub-par and interest rates were sky-high. And as is so typical, investors projected out into the future what they were seeing. That\'s their unshakable habit: looking into the rear-view mirror instead of through the windshield. What they were observing, looking backward, made them very discouraged about the country. They were projecting high interest rates, they were projecting low profits, and they were therefore valuing the Dow at a level that was the same as 17 years earlier, even though GDP had nearly quintupled.

And so here\'s what equities did in that same 17 years: If you\'d invested $1 million in the Dow on Nov. 16, 1981, and reinvested all dividends, you\'d have had $19,720,112 on Dec. 31, 1998. And your annual return would have been 19%. The increase in equity values since 1981 beats anything you can find in history. This increase even surpasses what you would have realized if you\'d bought stocks in 1932, at their Depression bottom--on its lowest day, July 8, 1932, the Dow closed at 41.22--and held them for 17 years.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/warren-buffett-on-stock-market/\n\nSource 6:\nThen came the 1980s.

Contrast that with the federal deficit in fiscal year 2023, which topped $1.7 trillion <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSD>, an amount larger than Mexico’s total economy (the 12th largest in the world).

In 1993, for instance, the annual deficit amounted to 3.8% of GDP, and the debt, which seemed astronomically high at a “mere” $4.4 trillion <https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/historical-debt-outstanding/historical-debt-outstanding>, was Lilliputian by today’s standards.\n\nThe trend goes back longer than that. The growth of the U.S. government in modern times is the story of post-WWII America. President Dwight Eisenhower seems to have been the last guy in the post-WWII era who understood that the welfare state, the warfare state, and tax cuts not backed by tough spending cuts are incompatible with fiscally responsible government, or at least with reasonably-sized government. His predecessor, Harry Truman, who had funded the Korean War effort, left Eisenhower a level of federal spending equivalent to 18.5% of GDP. Between then and now <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYONGDA188S>, both parties, with short-lived exceptions, have pushed both the defense and domestic budgets exponentially higher.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/24/national-debt-34-trillion-america-government-finances/\n\nSource 8:\nThere was a time, even in the middle of the Cold War, when government leaders, despite their international responsibilities and the onerous legacy of the New Deal and Great Society that nobody dared reverse, understood the need for fiscal discipline and containing the growth of government.\n\nBetween 1947 and 1966, the budget was balanced in 12 years, while the rest of the time there was a negligible average deficit of 0.07%. Contrast that with the 12 years under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush (mostly with a hostile or partly hostile Congress), which averaged a 4% deficit due to defense spending increases, abandonment of domestic restraint—a legacy of Johnson’s “bread and butter” years and the Nixon-Ford presidencies’ about-face on most of the economic principles they previously had espoused—and the unfunded tax cuts influenced by Arthur Laffer’s notion that tax cuts would pay for themselves. Gone was Eisenhower’s discipline, who insisted on slashing spending before he cut taxes.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/24/national-debt-34-trillion-america-government-finances/\n\nSource 9:\nStrassman, a lecturer at the National Defense University and an expert in cyberterrorism.

Second, it involves a scenario spilling out of conflict in the oil fields of the Middle East that now seems eerily plausible, if not yet entirely likely. That\'s followed by terrorist assaults against oil fields in the Persian Gulf and U.S. military installations, accompanied by a devastating cyberassault on the computer networks of U.S. financial institutions as well as power grids in the New York area--assaults intended to inflict further psychological and economic damage on the U.S. In the simulation the terrorists succeeded spectacularly.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/battered-but-unbroken-fortune-classics-2001/'}

When 2000 rolled around, we were working every bit as hard as in the 1960s, and far more of us were working—48% of the population versus 38%. Even so, the economy wasn’t even as big as its minimum projected size in The Year 2000. What went wrong is no mystery. The forecasters extrapolated the previous 20 years of labor productivity growth into the future, but in fact productivity growth slumped deeply. The “productivity paradox” continues and still isn’t well understood, but the lesson is clear: Extrapolating any trend decades into the future is asking for trouble.\n\nSo the Bright Future view of 2000 was wrong—but thankfully the Dark Future view that emerged around 1980 was even further off. That view was summarized in a U.S. government report titled Global 2000. With utter confidence it predicted a colder, hungrier, poorer world of poisoned seas and food wars in the streets.

Just weeks ago the phrase was a history book curiosity that seemingly had no meaning in the modern age. No more. Stock markets around the world have just gone through a classic panic, unique in its high-tech mechanics and the magnitude of the price collapse but no different in substance or dynamics from those of 1929 and 1907. What set it off? Pundits, politicians, and professional investors cite an array of causes. The failure of Congress and the Administration to deal adequately with the federal budget deficit. The stubbornly high U.S. trade deficit. Deepening crisis in the Middle East. Treasury Secretary James Baker\'s threat to force the dollar down sharply against the German mark. The pernicious influence of so-called program traders on Wall Street. Proposed tax legislation that could bring corporate takeovers, and even friendly acquisitions, to a dead halt. Tight monetary policy that left the markets starved for liquidity and helped push interest rates on government bonds above 10%. Many of those surely affected the market.
