After the ruling, Musk announced that he would seek to move Tesla’s headquarters from Delaware to Texas, where courts might be more deferential. The Tesla board has asked investors to reapprove Musk’s pay and the move south. Shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis <https://fortune.com/2024/05/30/tesla-claps-back-adviser-critical-musk-billions/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks> and Institutional Shareholder Services have recommended that investors vote against the pay package, while the Tesla board and its independent chair Robyn Denholm are urging investors <https://fortune.com/2024/05/18/tesla-chair-robyn-denholm-ceo-elon-musk-pay-package-oversight-annual-meeting/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks> to back the company and its CEO.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-brother-besties-pay-billions-nyc/\n\nSource 9:\nAccording to Lander, however, Tesla doesn’t have a full-time CEO who is focused on growing the EV maker, and Musk is “chasing shiny new objects” at the moment. He and other investors in the past have complained that Musk isn’t focused enough on Tesla and is distracted by social media and a half-dozen other companies where he holds leadership roles, including X <https://fortune.com/company/twitter/>, xAI, Neuralink, and the Boring Company.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-brother-besties-pay-billions-nyc/\n\nSource 10:\nTo be sure, the Tesla Model Y is still the top-selling car in California year-to-date, CNCDA reported. And, Tesla is California\'s second-best-selling brand after Toyota. Furthermore, the Model Y competes in the red-hot SUV/crossover segment, which dominates the market. The Model 3 competes in the shrinking passenger car segment, where sales dropped 13.1%, while SUVs rose 3.4%. The Model Y sells nearly three times the volume of the Model 3.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether that future could be at risk due to Musk’s political affiliations. His strong political stance has gone against the grain compared to other high-profile CEOs. A rep for JPMorgan Chase <https://fortune.com/company/jpmorgan-chase/> CEO Jamie Dimon, for instance, issued a denial <https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-jamie-dimon-endorsement-jpmorgan-chase/> this month that Dimon had endorsed Trump. \n\nOverall, that trend has held for much of this election season. However, talking politics in the workplace is likely to ramp up in the next few weeks as votes pour in and employees head to the polls in November.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/26/tesla-honda-toyota-cadillac-elon-musk-trump-election-earnings-stock-robovan-robotaxi-california/'}

He and other investors in the past have complained that Musk isn’t focused enough on Tesla and is distracted by social media and a half-dozen other companies where he holds leadership roles, including X <https://fortune.com/company/twitter/>, xAI, Neuralink, and the Boring Company.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-brother-besties-pay-billions-nyc/\n\nSource 10:\nTo be sure, the Tesla Model Y is still the top-selling car in California year-to-date, CNCDA reported. And, Tesla is California\'s second-best-selling brand after Toyota. Furthermore, the Model Y competes in the red-hot SUV/crossover segment, which dominates the market. The Model 3 competes in the shrinking passenger car segment, where sales dropped 13.1%, while SUVs rose 3.4%. The Model Y sells nearly three times the volume of the Model 3.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether that future could be at risk due to Musk’s political affiliations. His strong political stance has gone against the grain compared to other high-profile CEOs. A rep for JPMorgan Chase <https://fortune.com/company/jpmorgan-chase/> CEO Jamie Dimon, for instance, issued a denial <https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-jamie-dimon-endorsement-jpmorgan-chase/> this month that Dimon had endorsed Trump. \n\nOverall, that trend has held for much of this election season. However, talking politics in the workplace is likely to ramp up in the next few weeks as votes pour in and employees head to the polls in November.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/26/tesla-honda-toyota-cadillac-elon-musk-trump-election-earnings-stock-robovan-robotaxi-california/'}

While Tesla’s stock sits roughly where it was four years ago, Broadcom’s is up about 290% over that time.\n\nMusk has not been sheepish about staking <https://fortune.com/2024/09/28/elon-musk-tesla-robotaxi-autonomous-self-driving-cars-robots-ai/> the company’s future on autonomous software. Currently, what Tesla calls “full self-driving” is considered a level two-plus autonomous product <https://www.simplyfleet.app/blog/levels-of-autonomous-vehicles>, per Goldstein.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/teslas-big-robotaxi-reveal-will-it-be-more-style-or-substance/\n\nSource 6:\nMany Tesla investors were willing to put up with CEO Elon Musk’s widely covered behavior—his split attention <https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/23/elon-musk-splits-time-across-spacex-tesla-and-twitter-heres-how.html> with X <https://fortune.com/company/twitter/>; off-color remarks <https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/world/europe/elon-musk-auschwitz-jewish-antisemitism.html>, the worst of which have been bigoted <https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-actual-truth-antisemitic-post-backlash-advertisers/>; and the lack <https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-gross-margin-falls-fourth-quarter-2024-01-24/> of clear guidance about when new models would be released—so long as the stock kept up its stellar performance. But since the start of the year Tesla’s stock has fallen 43%. Tesla also had its first quarterly sales decline in four years. All this comes as the global EV market seems to be flatlining rather than growing, as many carmakers predicted. All that has some of Tesla’s\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/22/tesla-elon-musk-earnings-q1-2024-model-2-sales-share-price-dan-ives-per-lekander/\n\nSource 7:\nViecha’s exit came soon after senior vice president Drew Baglino resigned and cashed out a $181 million stake in the company <https://fortune.com/2024/04/26/tesla-elon-musk-drew-baglino-insider-sale-ron-baron/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks>. Baglino had been with Tesla for 18 years and was a stalwart among investors and analysts. Rohan Patel, the company’s vice president of public policy and business development, parted ways at the same time as Baglino <https://fortune.com/2024/04/15/tesla-top-engineering-exec-drew-baglino-elon-musk-ceo-succession/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/tesla-layoffs-morale-rich-otto-pound-of-flesh/\n\nSource 8:\nBut in recent months, after recalling millions of its cars <https://qz.com/tesla-car-recalls-china-model-y-accidents-autopilot-1851144035> and watching vehicle sales start to decline, the company has been hit by layoffs, hiring freezes, and senior resignations.\n\n“With [Tesla’s] rapid growth there has been duplication of roles and job functions in certain areas,” Musk wrote to employees last month <https://qz.com/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-tweets-ev-q1-sales-1851385048>, as he explained that at least 14,000 workers were set to lose their jobs. “There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done.”\n\nSince then, employees have gotten layoff notices in waves over the course of four weeks. "I keep waiting for Elon to send another email and tell us they\'re finally done firing people," one current Tesla worker told Business Insider. <https://www.businessinsider.com/more-tesla-layoffs-workers-post-2024-5>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/elon-musk-tesla-slashed-over-3400-job-postings-3-listed-us/\n\nSource 9:\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\nMusk’s pay was rescinded in January by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who determined the board’s process for awarding stock options then valued at $56 billion to Musk lacked independence and that the deal wasn’t properly negotiated. After the ruling, Musk announced that he would seek to move Tesla’s headquarters from Delaware to Texas, where courts might be more deferential. The Tesla board has asked investors to reapprove Musk’s pay and the move south. Shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis <https://fortune.com/2024/05/30/tesla-claps-back-adviser-critical-musk-billions/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks> and Institutional Shareholder Services have recommended that investors vote against the pay package, while the Tesla board and its independent chair Robyn Denholm are urging investors <https://fortune.com/2024/05/18/tesla-chair-robyn-denholm-ceo-elon-musk-pay-package-oversight-annual-meeting/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks> to back the company and its CEO.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-brother-besties-pay-billions-nyc/\n\nSource 9:\nAccording to Lander, however, Tesla doesn’t have a full-time CEO who is focused on growing the EV maker, and Musk is “chasing shiny new objects” at the moment. He and other investors in the past have complained that Musk isn’t focused enough on Tesla and is distracted by social media and a half-dozen other companies where he holds leadership roles, including X <https://fortune.com/company/twitter/>, xAI, Neuralink, and the Boring Company.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-brother-besties-pay-billions-nyc/\n\nSource 10:\nTo be sure, the Tesla Model Y is still the top-selling car in California year-to-date, CNCDA reported. And, Tesla is California\'s second-best-selling brand after Toyota. Furthermore, the Model Y competes in the red-hot SUV/crossover segment, which dominates the market. The Model 3 competes in the shrinking passenger car segment, where sales dropped 13.1%, while SUVs rose 3.4%. The Model Y sells nearly three times the volume of the Model 3.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether that future could be at risk due to Musk’s political affiliations. His strong political stance has gone against the grain compared to other high-profile CEOs. A rep for JPMorgan Chase <https://fortune.com/company/jpmorgan-chase/> CEO Jamie Dimon, for instance, issued a denial <https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-jamie-dimon-endorsement-jpmorgan-chase/> this month that Dimon had endorsed Trump. \n\nOverall, that trend has held for much of this election season. However, talking politics in the workplace is likely to ramp up in the next few weeks as votes pour in and employees head to the polls in November.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/26/tesla-honda-toyota-cadillac-elon-musk-trump-election-earnings-stock-robovan-robotaxi-california/'}

2024-11-07 23:17:23,969: ObserveEventsHandler(  206): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd last message: Who is the CEO of Tesla as of 2023?

2024-11-07 23:17:23,969: ObserveEventsHandler(  207): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd response: assistant: As of 2023, Elon Musk is still the CEO of Tesla [3]. Despite some investors and critics calling for a change in leadership, Musk has maintained his position as CEO. In fact, some investors, like Gary Black of The Future Fund, believe that there is no one else who can fill Musk's shoes, and that the alternative to Musk as CEO is "just too hard to fathom" [1]. Additionally, Musk has taken steps to ensure that no one else can succeed him, having removed top lieutenants like Zach Kirkhorn and Drew Baglino, who were seen as potential successors [1].
