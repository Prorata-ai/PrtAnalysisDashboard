Prices rose by 2.4% in the Eurozone in April, while in March the U.K.’s CPI rate measured 3.4%, putting the former on a faster track to interest rate cuts.\n\nEisenschmidt said the source of this stickier inflation was up for debate. However, the blame could be pinned on a mounting worklessness crisis in the U.K.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/04/think-about-europe-but-everything-a-little-worse-the-u-k-economy-could-stare-down-long-term-irrelevance-without-immigration/\n\nSource 4:\nIn the second-biggest exercise in democracy <https://apnews.com/hub/global-elections/> behind India's recent elections, almost 400 million voters will elect 720 members of the European Parliament from beyond the Arctic circle to the edges of Africa and Asia, impacting anything from global climate policies and defense to migration issues and geopolitical relations with China and the United States.\n\nFor the longest time, the European Parliament elections had little importance, as core members France and Germany set much of the policy for the ever-increasing group and the legislature looked like a retirement home for elderly national politicians and an incubator for young talent.\n\nBut as the powers of the legislature grew on issues like banking rules, agriculture and the EU budget, so did voting interest and the quality of legislators. While breaking a 50% voter turnout threshold was considered a major step forward in 2019, an EU Parliament survey says 71% could vote in the upcoming elections, another massive step forward.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/05/shift-to-the-right-in-this-weeks-european-union-elections-the-question-is-how-big/\n\nSource 5:\nOn the IPO front, the London Stock Exchange has been battling a drought of new listings <https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/16/london-stock-exchange-ceo-julia-hoggett-not-concern-uk-drop-listings/>, with many high-growth companies choosing other European markets or the U.S. rather than the U.K.\n\nTracxn recorded only three U.K. IPOs, that of Marex, AWAKN, and Perfect Moment.\n\nThere were only 546 active institutional investors operating in the U.K. during the first half of 2024, compared with 729 during the first half of 2023. The number of international investors saw a similar decline, falling from 437 in H1 2023 to 326 in 2024.\n\nWith the arrival of new U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, many will be hoping that the first Labour government in 14 years will continue to support the U.K.’s position as a critical player in the global tech landscape.\n\nCorrection, July 8, 2024: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Mews was founded in Amsterdam.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/07/05/uk-tech-overtakes-china-cementing-position-worlds-second-largest-ecosystem-funding/\n\nSource 6:\nGood morning. \n\nAs a little kid in Scotland, I remember my dad told me the ruling Labour Party was bad for business. Barely 30, he was an entrepreneur trying to support three kids in a land of strikes, power cuts, inflation and high taxes. We moved to Canada before the Conservative Margaret Thatcher became Britain’s prime minister in 1979. \n\nLabour’s back! With yesterday’s U.K. election, Keir Starmer is set to become Britain’s first Labour prime minister in 14 years, promising to be both “pro-business and pro-worker.” (Click here for the Labour Party Manifesto <https://labour.org.uk/change/>—a term that some might associate with communism, until they see the accompanying photo of Starmer.)\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/05/uk-election-outcome-labour-win-business-investors-ian-bremmer/\n\nSource 6:\nI asked two pundits I respect to weigh in on the impact of Labour’s win. Ian Bremmer, founder and president of Eurasia Group, called it “a much-needed positive story,” adding that “a Labour government is going to be good for the United Kingdom’s standing in the world and its economic outlook.” Moreover, a victory for Starmer would “allow him to deliver political stability and policy certainty—something the U.K. has been sorely missing for much of the last decade. Moreover, I expect Starmer to implement a coherent economic policy and a major reset with the European Union—both of which will improve the outlook for domestic and international investors.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/05/uk-election-outcome-labour-win-business-investors-ian-bremmer/\n\nSource 7:\nVoters head to the polls for the UK general election after the last campaign day was dominated by more opinion polls projecting an historic victory for Keir Starmer and even Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper endorsing the opposition Labour Party rather than Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives.\n\n“Today, Britain can begin a new chapter,” Starmer said in his last message before polling stations open at 7 a.m. on Thursday. He pledged “a new age of hope and opportunity after 14 years of chaos and decline,” in remarks provided by his office, which it said were meant to encourage people to turn out and not assume Labour had won. “Change will only happen if you vote for it.”\n\nSunak made one more appeal to typically Conservative-minded voters who’ve become disaffected during his administration, urging them to vote Tory to stop Labour having “unchecked power.” His strategy has pivoted in the final weeks of the campaign to an effective concession that his party is going to lose.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/07/04/voters-head-to-the-polls-for-uk-general-election-keir-starmers-labour-on-course-historic-victory/\n\nSource 8:\nMicrosoft’s plan to open a new AI hub in London is a huge endorsement for the U.K. as a world leader in AI. But I do question whether it is wholly good news for the long-term.\n\nThe U.K. has shown time and again that some of the very best AI expertise in the world lies here. The pool of talent we have available in this country, the standard of research and development present in our academic institutions, and the U.K.’s (generally) stable economic conditions have, for decades, made our island nation a highly attractive place for tech’s big hitters to lay down roots. \n\nThat’s why American businesses come here, as well as companies from Japan, China, South Korea, Germany, and Singapore. And recent history highlights the real pedigree we have in software process and design. \n\nWhen Britain built its own behemoths\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/17/big-tech-pouring-billions-london-ai-investments-uk-sidekick-us-tech-giants/\n\nSource 9:\n“The probability of Labour doing anything negative with the current trajectory is very low,” says Taylor. He added that he’s met with half a dozen payment companies and fintechs with banking licenses waiting for regulation in order to issue stablecoins. He expects that once the legislation goes live, there will be a “significant increase” in ready-to-go sterling-backed coins.\n\nSpotlight on crypto in the U.S. election\n\nThe U.K.’s nonpartisan approach is shining a light on crypto’s politicization in the U.S. During its arrest-warrant era of 2022, it was an industry that could unite both sides of the aisle in Congress; it was a question of law and order, not right versus left. But this year, its story has increasingly become one of the Democrats versus the Republicans.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/08/02/uk-government-labour-big-tech-a16z-crypto-rachel-reeves/"}
