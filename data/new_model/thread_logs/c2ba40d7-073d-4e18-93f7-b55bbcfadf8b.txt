If you’re hungry after a 5:30 dinner before you go to bed, it might be too early for you. Consider testing out a 6:30 or 7 p.m. meal. \n * Avoid late-night snacking. Schmidt warns that eating an early dinner and then snacking late at night offsets the benefits: “We know that when people eat later at night, they have a higher risk of obesity.” \n * Plan ahead for the busy days. “I recognize that my kid has sports every Wednesday, so every Wednesday is going to be Crockpot Wednesday because we have to get in the house, change over, get them dinner, and get out again, as opposed to waiting until after practice,” Schmidt says. \nKeep in mind, experts have said <https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/25/best-time-to-eat-dinner/> that what is on your plate is still more important than when you eat. Half the plate should consist of non-starchy vegetables, a fourth should have lean protein, and another fourth should have a whole grain or starchy vegetable. \n\nFor more on healthy eating:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/early-dinner-time-improve-health/\n\nSource 1:\nThere are the night owls <https://fortune.com/well/2023/09/11/night-owls-unhealthy-lifestyle-habits-higher-risk-diabetes/> who refuse to turn the stove on until half past eight and eat out only when the late-night ambience draws in the crowds. Then there are those hangry ones who loathe a late dinner reservation and swear by an early meal well before the sun sets. Like my mom says, who wants to sit hungry for hours just to eat when the cool kids do?\nDinnertimes have been trending earlier. According to Resy <https://blog.resy.com/2022/05/5-p-m-is-the-new-8-p-m-at-new-york-restaurants-and-i-couldnt-be-happier/>, an online reservation platform, more people have been making reservations at 5:30 p.m. in New York City, and fewer people have been making them at 8 p.m. compared to years prior. Last year, the number of dinner reservations made before 5 p.m. doubled compared to 2019, according to Yelp <https://www.marketplace.org/2023/09/22/6-p-m-dinner-reservations-are-losing-their-stigma/>. Not to mention, an unintended benefit of the 5:30 dinner is having your pick of the litter at more restaurants that tend to get booked weeks in advance in the seventh hour. \n\nWherever you sit on the pendulum that is the debate over the best time to eat dinner, there’s a growing case that an early-bird meal can help improve your overall health and well-being. \n\nThe health benefits of an early dinner \n\nIt may help prevent heartburn\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/early-dinner-time-improve-health/\n\nSource 1:\n“If you assume 5:30 p.m. is ‘too early’ for dinner, you might end up snacking on processed carbs like chips and crackers, which can lead to overeating,” Muhlstein says. \n\nIf you’re still hungry after an early dinner, don’t fret. You may consider adjusting the time you eat. If you need a snack, Schmidt recommends grabbing something high in water content, like easily digestible fruit, or a food high in fiber and protein to sustain fullness, like a whole grain. \n\nYou may lower your disease risk \n\nEating late at night has been associated with a higher overall calorie intake and an increased risk for obesity <https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(22)00397-7#%20>. One study suggests that the hormone responsible for feeling full, leptin A, decreases later in the day, which can lead to overeating when you have a late meal. Particularly for those with diabetes or obesity, eating earlier can also help with insulin sensitivity.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/early-dinner-time-improve-health/\n\nSource 2:\nHow often in a week do you dine out versus cook at home?\n\nI cook for myself and my partner about 3 to 4 times a week. We otherwise order food (often an Indian, Japanese or Chinese) or eat out. When eating out I like to try cuisines I have never experienced for. One of my most memorable eating experiences was at a place called Dilara, an Uighur cuisine restaurant in Finsbury Park. I happened to be in the area, saw it on Google Maps, and decided to try it. The food was so spicy, redolent and full of flavour, with hand-pulled noodles and intoxicating Sichuan peppers. It never ceases to amaze me how many exquisite foodstuffs lie in wait to be discovered from across our planet.\n\nThe treats\n\nHow do you unwind from the top job?\n\nI am the first to admit that, after a long and stressful day, I like to unwind with a drink.

I will happily spend up to £20 on lunch and like to eat all sorts of different cuisines from around the world. My idea of suffering would be to eat the same dish, day in, day out.\n\nIf I am dining in a business context, I like to eat something simple and easy to eat to avoid any faux pas moments—Flat Iron is a good choice for a flavoursome steak and side salad.\n\nWhere do you buy groceries?\n\nUsually from M&S, as this is closest to my home.\n\nHow often in a week do you dine out versus cook at home?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/01/pasta-evangelists-millennial-co-founder-the-good-life/\n\nSource 3:\nLet them eat pesto pasta, JetBlue decrees.\n\nThis summer, the airline tried out a new menu sans hot food for international coach passengers flying into Dublin and Edinburgh.

If you’re hungry after a 5:30 dinner before you go to bed, it might be too early for you. Consider testing out a 6:30 or 7 p.m. meal. \n * Avoid late-night snacking. Schmidt warns that eating an early dinner and then snacking late at night offsets the benefits: “We know that when people eat later at night, they have a higher risk of obesity.” \n * Plan ahead for the busy days. “I recognize that my kid has sports every Wednesday, so every Wednesday is going to be Crockpot Wednesday because we have to get in the house, change over, get them dinner, and get out again, as opposed to waiting until after practice,” Schmidt says. \nKeep in mind, experts have said <https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/25/best-time-to-eat-dinner/> that what is on your plate is still more important than when you eat. Half the plate should consist of non-starchy vegetables, a fourth should have lean protein, and another fourth should have a whole grain or starchy vegetable. \n\nFor more on healthy eating:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/early-dinner-time-improve-health/\n\nSource 1:\nThere are the night owls <https://fortune.com/well/2023/09/11/night-owls-unhealthy-lifestyle-habits-higher-risk-diabetes/> who refuse to turn the stove on until half past eight and eat out only when the late-night ambience draws in the crowds. Then there are those hangry ones who loathe a late dinner reservation and swear by an early meal well before the sun sets. Like my mom says, who wants to sit hungry for hours just to eat when the cool kids do?\nDinnertimes have been trending earlier. According to Resy <https://blog.resy.com/2022/05/5-p-m-is-the-new-8-p-m-at-new-york-restaurants-and-i-couldnt-be-happier/>, an online reservation platform, more people have been making reservations at 5:30 p.m. in New York City, and fewer people have been making them at 8 p.m. compared to years prior. Last year, the number of dinner reservations made before 5 p.m. doubled compared to 2019, according to Yelp <https://www.marketplace.org/2023/09/22/6-p-m-dinner-reservations-are-losing-their-stigma/>. Not to mention, an unintended benefit of the 5:30 dinner is having your pick of the litter at more restaurants that tend to get booked weeks in advance in the seventh hour. \n\nWherever you sit on the pendulum that is the debate over the best time to eat dinner, there’s a growing case that an early-bird meal can help improve your overall health and well-being. \n\nThe health benefits of an early dinner \n\nIt may help prevent heartburn\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/early-dinner-time-improve-health/\n\nSource 1:\n“If you assume 5:30 p.m. is ‘too early’ for dinner, you might end up snacking on processed carbs like chips and crackers, which can lead to overeating,” Muhlstein says. \n\nIf you’re still hungry after an early dinner, don’t fret. You may consider adjusting the time you eat. If you need a snack, Schmidt recommends grabbing something high in water content, like easily digestible fruit, or a food high in fiber and protein to sustain fullness, like a whole grain. \n\nYou may lower your disease risk \n\nEating late at night has been associated with a higher overall calorie intake and an increased risk for obesity <https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(22)00397-7#%20>. One study suggests that the hormone responsible for feeling full, leptin A, decreases later in the day, which can lead to overeating when you have a late meal.

We otherwise order food (often an Indian, Japanese or Chinese) or eat out. When eating out I like to try cuisines I have never experienced for. One of my most memorable eating experiences was at a place called Dilara, an Uighur cuisine restaurant in Finsbury Park. I happened to be in the area, saw it on Google Maps, and decided to try it. The food was so spicy, redolent and full of flavour, with hand-pulled noodles and intoxicating Sichuan peppers. It never ceases to amaze me how many exquisite foodstuffs lie in wait to be discovered from across our planet.\n\nThe treats\n\nHow do you unwind from the top job?\n\nI am the first to admit that, after a long and stressful day, I like to unwind with a drink.

One of my most memorable eating experiences was at a place called Dilara, an Uighur cuisine restaurant in Finsbury Park. I happened to be in the area, saw it on Google Maps, and decided to try it.

Plus it works well with the greasy, crunchy dish. “Its lovely fresh acidity pairs so well with salty and fatty foods,” she says.\n\nChang has revived Bubbledogs <https://www.dorchestercollection.com/london/45-park-lane/dining/cut-at-45-park-lane> for this summer’s popup at 45 Park Lane Hotel, and there’s brisk business for the fried chicken wings to go with the sparkling-only list of almost 50 options.\nOne of the city’s newer options comes from Bebe Bob <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-25/13-best-new-london-restaurants-rotisserie-chicken-and-900-japanese-beef>, whose older sibling Bob Bob Ricard <https://bobbobricard.com/> is renowned for its “Press for Champagne” buttons at every booth. At Bebe Bob, notably juicy nuggets in a crunchy crust are available at lunch, with the option of a dozen Champagnes. They’ve been an instant best seller, but founder Leonid Shutov says they couldn’t meet demand at dinner because there’s a limited quantity of the Landes chicken they source. “We simply would not be able to get enough of this very special bird to offer these nuggets through the day,” he says.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/23/how-uk-fell-in-love-fried-chicken-morleys-amelia-dimoldenberg-chicken-shop-dates-popeyes-launch-london-champagne/"}

2024-11-07 23:11:45,513: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Deciding what to make for dinner can be a daily dilemma! According to experts, what's on your plate is more important than when you eat [1]. A balanced meal with half the plate consisting of non-starchy vegetables, a fourth with lean protein, and another fourth with a whole grain or starchy vegetable is a great starting point [1].

If you're looking for inspiration, you could consider trying out a new cuisine, like Uighur or Japanese, which can be a fun and flavorful option [2]. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for something comforting, a warm chicken or fish dish with a side of soup or salad could be a great choice [3]. Whatever you decide, make sure to choose ingredients that are nutritious and appealing to your taste buds.

2024-11-07 23:11:46,146: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Deciding what to make for dinner can be a daily dilemma! According to experts, what's on your plate is more important than when you eat [1]. A balanced meal with half the plate consisting of non-starchy vegetables, a fourth with lean protein, and another fourth with a whole grain or starchy vegetable is a great starting point [1].

If you're looking for inspiration, you could consider trying out a new cuisine, like Uighur or Japanese, which can be a fun and flavorful option [2]. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for something comforting, a warm chicken or fish dish with a side of soup or salad could be a great choice [3]. Whatever you decide, make sure to choose ingredients that are nutritious and appealing to your taste buds.

Remember, the key is to find a meal that works for you and your schedule. If you're short on time, a quick and easy option like a whole grain with lean protein and veggies can be a great solution [1]. And if you're feeling adventurous, you could try out a new recipe or cooking technique to mix things up. Whatever you choose, I hope you enjoy your dinner!
