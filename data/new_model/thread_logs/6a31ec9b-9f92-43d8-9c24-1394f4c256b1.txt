Your self-definitions, your voice, your name—it all matters. It’s all part of your story. As a communicator, I believe that words, language, and discourse help shape our history and legacy. As a Black woman, I’ve felt the impact of representation. And as an executive at one of the leading nonprofits <https://www.cfchildren.org/> championing social-emotional learning <https://www.cfchildren.org/what-is-social-emotional-learning/>, I deeply understand the importance of cultivating life skills like self-awareness, nurturing a healthy relationship with oneself, effective communication, and perspective-taking. I also recognize the responsibility I have in my leadership role. The way leaders show up in the workplace can make all the difference in creating a sense of belonging and psychological safety <https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=54851> for teams. I’m committed to using my influence to advocate for others, build high-functioning workplace relationships, and push for work cultures where humans feel seen, heard, and valued. Why? Because liberation is on the line. And I’d hate to see anyone else wait 20-plus years to use their real name at work.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.60260576), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='79e8e946-cf0f-402d-b1b9-0df9bea044c1', embedding=None, metadata={'id': '785ac7e6945d774fdcdac81e9c467bf77fb2573ca556282a40906c30101bcb2d-9', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': '785ac7e6945d774fdcdac81e9c467bf77fb2573ca556282a40906c30101bcb2d', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20240702, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-07', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2151914112-e1719933909859.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2024, 'date_month': 7, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/bill-gates-leopold-aschenbrenner-treatise-agi-superintelligence/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 2, 'title': 'A former OpenAI researcher sees a clear path to AGI this decade.

And as an executive at one of the leading nonprofits <https://www.cfchildren.org/> championing social-emotional learning <https://www.cfchildren.org/what-is-social-emotional-learning/>, I deeply understand the importance of cultivating life skills like self-awareness, nurturing a healthy relationship with oneself, effective communication, and perspective-taking.

I’m committed to using my influence to advocate for others, build high-functioning workplace relationships, and push for work cultures where humans feel seen, heard, and valued. Why?

No, I don\'t know why I don\'t see him. Of all the things that I hated about my childhood, nothing compared to the revolving door of father figures.”\n\nSo he decided to change his name again, to Vance — the last name of his beloved Mamaw, the grandmother who raised him.\n\nIt didn\'t happen on his wedding day in 2014, as the book implies, but in April 2013, as he was about to graduate from Yale, Van Kirk said.

Hamel would require a few additional awkward moments,” he writes in “Hillbilly Elegy.” “Yeah, my legal father\'s last name is Hamel. You haven\'t met him because I don\'t see him. No, I don\'t know why I don\'t see him. Of all the things that I hated about my childhood, nothing compared to the revolving door of father figures.”\n\nSo he decided to change his name again, to Vance — the last name of his beloved Mamaw, the grandmother who raised him.\n\nIt didn\'t happen on his wedding day in 2014, as the book implies, but in April 2013, as he was about to graduate from Yale, Van Kirk said. It felt right to take the name of the woman who raised him before dying in 2005, as he was putting the struggles of his early life behind him and launching into this new phase.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-is-jd-vance-real-name-origin-john-david-hamel/'}

Because the first President of Cornell was named Andrew D. While. Elwyn Brooks there acquired the nickname Andy. His intimates still use it. Also missing from his blurb is the fact that he was a successful advertising-copy writer, that he sometimes dreams of expressing himself as clearly in speech as in print, and that the most romantic episode in his career was probably his sudden marriage in 1929—an office surprise—to Kath-arine Sergeant Angell, then literary editor of The New Yorker. In her own right she will be discussed. The record of E. B.

LaShuna is a representation of where I come from and who I am, a symbol of my Blackness. This full-circle moment feels incredibly liberating, and I want this type of emancipation for others within the community.\n\nShowing up as yourself\n\nMy mother taught me that every person has many layers that make them who they are. These layers should be celebrated and honored, not hidden or suppressed. Reestablishing my true name at this stage of my career has served as an exciting reminder that I am multi-dimensional and constantly evolving. Regardless of how others may perceive me based on my identity characteristics, I have the power to define who I am.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/06/black-women-careers-leadership-success-birth-name-code-switching/\n\nSource 4:\nThe way you communicate your story matters. Your self-definitions, your voice, your name—it all matters. It’s all part of your story. As a communicator, I believe that words, language, and discourse help shape our history and legacy. As a Black woman, I’ve felt the impact of representation. And as an executive at one of the leading nonprofits <https://www.cfchildren.org/> championing social-emotional learning <https://www.cfchildren.org/what-is-social-emotional-learning/>, I deeply understand the importance of cultivating life skills like self-awareness, nurturing a healthy relationship with oneself, effective communication, and perspective-taking. I also recognize the responsibility I have in my leadership role. The way leaders show up in the workplace can make all the difference in creating a sense of belonging and psychological safety <https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=54851> for teams. I’m committed to using my influence to advocate for others, build high-functioning workplace relationships, and push for work cultures where humans feel seen, heard, and valued. Why? Because liberation is on the line. And I’d hate to see anyone else wait 20-plus years to use their real name at work.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/06/black-women-careers-leadership-success-birth-name-code-switching/\n\nSource 5:\nJeremy Kahn\njeremy.kahn@fortune.com\n@jeremyakahn\n\nBefore we get to the news...If you want to learn more about where AI is taking us, and how we can harness the potential of this powerful technology while avoiding its substantial risks, please check out my forthcoming book, Mastering AI: A Survival Guide to Our Superpowered Future.
