Known as the Magnificent Seven, these stocks—Alphabet (GOOG , GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA)—make up about 30% of the S&P 500. “I think we could see more movement in the remaining 493 companies next year,” Denier says. “I also think we could see midcaps outperform large cap stocks.”\n\nWill there be a recession in 2024?\n\nFollowing two years of blistering inflation and aggressive rate hikes by the Fed, the “R” word was high on investors\' minds throughout 2023. Fortunately, a recession <https://fortune.com/recommends/banking/how-to-recession-proof-your-money/> never materialized, and a so-called “soft landing” seemed more likely.

In fact, JPMorgan predicted the S&P 500 would drop sharply <https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/outlook/market-outlook> this year.

Notably, last year’s No. 1, Builders Firstsource, and No. 3, Encore Wire <https://fortune.com/company/encore-wire/>, did not return to the list this year. Tesla <https://fortune.com/company/tesla/>, which ranked second in 2023, dropped to No. 42. Steel Dynamics <https://fortune.com/company/steel-dynamics/> and CF Industrial Holdings tied for the largest list drops from the previous year, both falling 75 places.

Business leaders are certainly no exception.\n\nI reached out to the CHROs from 10 companies, including Estée Lauder, Papa Johns, and Walmart, asking them to share their hopes for 2024, and what they plan to focus their energies on. \n\nTheir answers ran the gamut, from providing better support for middle managers, to concentrating on retaining talent. Several themes echoed across resolutions as a whole, including better investment into AI, emphasizing employee wellbeing, and improving employee learning and skills development. \n\nCori Davis, the chief people officer at biotechnology company Genentech, took a big picture approach to her resolution, and noted that the last several years have been difficult for everyone.

There are no predicted inflows in August from passive investors or mutual funds as capital has already been deployed for the third quarter, Rubner said. As for trend-following systematic funds, positioning has reached maximum length, indicating there’s no room for further buying. \n\nWhile some investors argue that strong earnings, a possible near-term interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, and the rising odds of Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential election would provide another boost for stocks, Rubner says they won’t be positive catalysts. \n\nSuch events are already getting priced into the market and the bar for earnings for the biggest technology stocks that drove market to record highs is remarkably high. “And by high, I mean they need to be great,” he wrote.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/17/goldman-sachs-top-strategist-precipice-of-a-summer-correction/\n\nSource 10:\nAnd Buffett said because Abel understands businesses so well, he also understands stocks.\n\nBut Edward Jones <https://fortune.com/company/jones-financial/> analyst James Shanahan said a good business doesn\'t always make a good stock unless you get the timing and position size right, and there is an art to that.\n\n"I think stock picking is hard.

However, the stock market <https://fortune.com/recommends/investing/what-are-stocks/> was one area of the economy that saw improvement. \n\nAfter plunging more than 18% in 2022, the S&P 500 rallied over 24% in 2023. (Fun fact: Every time the S&P 500 has fallen more than 18% in a year, it has then posted at least two consecutive years of gains.)\n\nNow the question is: Will this upward trajectory continue into 2024? And how can the average person get the most out of their investments next year? Here’s what experts say about what the stock market might do in 2024.\n\n2024 stock market outlook\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/recommends/investing/stock-market-outlook/\n\nSource 1:\nMukherjee says that interest rates are likely to fall through the year as the Fed becomes less hawkish and inflation continues to decline alongside moderate economic growth. “However, rates should stay at higher levels relative to the pre-Covid era,” he says. Additionally, although cash yields are attractive for now, “the appeal of high-quality bonds <https://fortune.com/recommends/investing/what-are-bonds/> will increase as the economy slows, and on better diversification attributes to risk assets,” he adds.\nAnthony Denier, CEO of the trading platform Webull, says he believes the stock market will ultimately post a positive return in 2024 as investors anticipate interest rate cuts by the Fed. However, he adds, we probably won’t see as big of a rally as we did in 2023. “Typically, returns are muted in the last year of a president’s term,” he says.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/recommends/investing/stock-market-outlook/\n\nSource 1:\nDenier also anticipates greater depth and diversity in the S&P 500. “This year, just seven companies provided most of the returns for the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ,” he says. Known as the Magnificent Seven, these stocks—Alphabet (GOOG , GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA)—make up about 30% of the S&P 500. “I think we could see more movement in the remaining 493 companies next year,” Denier says. “I also think we could see midcaps outperform large cap stocks.”\n\nWill there be a recession in 2024?\n\nFollowing two years of blistering inflation and aggressive rate hikes by the Fed, the “R” word was high on investors\' minds throughout 2023. Fortunately, a recession <https://fortune.com/recommends/banking/how-to-recession-proof-your-money/> never materialized, and a so-called “soft landing” seemed more likely. But investors are worried that the U.S. economy could still dip into a recession in 2024.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/recommends/investing/stock-market-outlook/\n\nSource 2:\nThe stock market stunned Wall Street last year with a massive gain, and it could top that this year with an even bigger surge.\n\nHelped by a U.S. economy that remained strong despite widespread predictions for a recession as well as a dovish shift in tone from the Federal Reserve last fall, the S&P 500 jumped 24% in 2023. \n\nOnly a handful of Wall Street analysts expected a rally of that magnitude, leading to skepticism that another huge leap was possible in 2024. In fact, JPMorgan predicted the S&P 500 would drop sharply <https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/outlook/market-outlook> this year. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley <https://fortune.com/company/morgan-stanley/> expected an average year <https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/us-stock-market-outlook-2024> with returns in the single digits, not a repeat of double-digit gains.\n\nFast forward to today, and the S&P 500 is already up 23% so far in 2024, nearly matching last year\'s advance. That\'s despite the Fed beginning its rate-cutting cycle later than hoped and with fewer cuts anticipated for the year.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/19/stock-market-outlook-sp500-6000-year-end-targets-economy-fed-rate-cuts/\n\nSource 3:\nAI chip supplier Nvidia <https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/> led the index <https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-stock-apples-3-trillion-valuation/> with a 239% gain in 2023. Meta and Tesla <https://fortune.com/company/tesla/>, two other tech giants involved in AI, surged 194% and 102%, respectively, last year. Goldman Sachs <https://fortune.com/company/goldman-sachs-group/> estimates that AI investment could reach as high as $200 billion globally by 2025. \n\nThe stock market gains that helped add so many millionaires in 2023 have persisted so far this year as the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq <https://fortune.com/company/nasdaq/> index hit record highs this week. The S&P 500 is up about 12% year-to-date and some of the biggest players in AI, like Nvidia and Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/>, have seen their shares continue to soar in 2024.\n\nCorrection, Jun. 11, 2024: This story has been updated with corrected figures for the number of new millionaires.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/08/ai-stock-boom-us-millionaires-600000-nvidia-meta-microsoft-sp500/\n\nSource 4:\n* Chicago Bears (From Carolina Panthers) \n * Washington Commanders \n * New England Patriots \n * Arizona Cardinals \n * Los Angeles Chargers \n * New York Giants \n * Tennessee Titans \n * Atlanta Falcons \n * Chicago Bears \n * New York Jets \n * Minnesota Vikings \n * Denver Broncos \n * Las Vegas Raiders \n * New Orleans Saints \n * Indianapolis Colts \n * Seattle Seahawks \n * Jacksonville Jaguars \n * Cincinnati Bengals \n * Los Angeles Rams \n * Pittsburgh Steelers \n * Miami Dolphins \n * Philadelphia Eagles \n * Minnesota Vikings \n * Dallas Cowboys \n * Green Bay Packers \n * Tampa Bay Buccaneers \n * Arizona Cardinals \n * Buffalo Bills \n * Detroit Lions \n * Baltimore Ravens \n * San Francisco 49ers \n * Kansas City Chiefs \nWhich players are first-round favorites in the 2024 NFL Draft?\n\nQuarterbacks should be in high demand this year.

However, he adds, we probably won’t see as big of a rally as we did in 2023. “Typically, returns are muted in the last year of a president’s term,” he says.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/recommends/investing/stock-market-outlook/\n\nSource 1:\nDenier also anticipates greater depth and diversity in the S&P 500. “This year, just seven companies provided most of the returns for the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ,” he says. Known as the Magnificent Seven, these stocks—Alphabet (GOOG , GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA)—make up about 30% of the S&P 500. “I think we could see more movement in the remaining 493 companies next year,” Denier says. “I also think we could see midcaps outperform large cap stocks.”\n\nWill there be a recession in 2024?\n\nFollowing two years of blistering inflation and aggressive rate hikes by the Fed, the “R” word was high on investors\' minds throughout 2023. Fortunately, a recession <https://fortune.com/recommends/banking/how-to-recession-proof-your-money/> never materialized, and a so-called “soft landing” seemed more likely. But investors are worried that the U.S. economy could still dip into a recession in 2024.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/recommends/investing/stock-market-outlook/\n\nSource 2:\nThe stock market stunned Wall Street last year with a massive gain, and it could top that this year with an even bigger surge.\n\nHelped by a U.S. economy that remained strong despite widespread predictions for a recession as well as a dovish shift in tone from the Federal Reserve last fall, the S&P 500 jumped 24% in 2023. \n\nOnly a handful of Wall Street analysts expected a rally of that magnitude, leading to skepticism that another huge leap was possible in 2024. In fact, JPMorgan predicted the S&P 500 would drop sharply <https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/outlook/market-outlook> this year. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley <https://fortune.com/company/morgan-stanley/> expected an average year <https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/us-stock-market-outlook-2024> with returns in the single digits, not a repeat of double-digit gains.\n\nFast forward to today, and the S&P 500 is already up 23% so far in 2024, nearly matching last year\'s advance. That\'s despite the Fed beginning its rate-cutting cycle later than hoped and with fewer cuts anticipated for the year.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/19/stock-market-outlook-sp500-6000-year-end-targets-economy-fed-rate-cuts/\n\nSource 3:\nAI chip supplier Nvidia <https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/> led the index <https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-stock-apples-3-trillion-valuation/> with a 239% gain in 2023. Meta and Tesla <https://fortune.com/company/tesla/>, two other tech giants involved in AI, surged 194% and 102%, respectively, last year. Goldman Sachs <https://fortune.com/company/goldman-sachs-group/> estimates that AI investment could reach as high as $200 billion globally by 2025. \n\nThe stock market gains that helped add so many millionaires in 2023 have persisted so far this year as the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq <https://fortune.com/company/nasdaq/> index hit record highs this week. The S&P 500 is up about 12% year-to-date and some of the biggest players in AI, like Nvidia and Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/>, have seen their shares continue to soar in 2024.\n\nCorrection, Jun. 11, 2024: This story has been updated with corrected figures for the number of new millionaires.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/08/ai-stock-boom-us-millionaires-600000-nvidia-meta-microsoft-sp500/\n\nSource 4:\n* Chicago Bears (From Carolina Panthers) \n * Washington Commanders \n * New England Patriots \n * Arizona Cardinals \n * Los Angeles Chargers \n * New York Giants \n * Tennessee Titans \n * Atlanta Falcons \n * Chicago Bears \n * New York Jets \n * Minnesota Vikings \n * Denver Broncos \n * Las Vegas Raiders \n * New Orleans Saints \n * Indianapolis Colts \n * Seattle Seahawks \n * Jacksonville Jaguars \n * Cincinnati Bengals \n * Los Angeles Rams \n * Pittsburgh Steelers \n * Miami Dolphins \n * Philadelphia Eagles \n * Minnesota Vikings \n * Dallas Cowboys \n * Green Bay Packers \n * Tampa Bay Buccaneers \n * Arizona Cardinals \n * Buffalo Bills \n * Detroit Lions \n * Baltimore Ravens \n * San Francisco 49ers \n * Kansas City Chiefs \nWhich players are first-round favorites in the 2024 NFL Draft?\n\nQuarterbacks should be in high demand this year.

In all, 25 companies returned from last year, a drop from last year’s 32 returning companies. Notably, last year’s No. 1, Builders Firstsource, and No. 3, Encore Wire <https://fortune.com/company/encore-wire/>, did not return to the list this year. Tesla <https://fortune.com/company/tesla/>, which ranked second in 2023, dropped to No. 42. Steel Dynamics <https://fortune.com/company/steel-dynamics/> and CF Industrial Holdings tied for the largest list drops from the previous year, both falling 75 places. Steel Dynamics dropped from No. 9 to No. 84, and CF Industrial fell from No. 22 to No. 97. Steel-pipe supplier Tenaris <https://fortune.com/company/tenaris/> saw the biggest increase in its ranking, jumping up to fifteenth this year from its place at No. 78 in 2023.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/29/2024-100-fastest-growing-companies-list-tesla-nvidia-energy/\n\nSource 6:\nGood morning!\n\nLove them or hate them <https://fortune.com/well/2022/12/24/sheryl-lee-ralph-on-why-shes-ditching-new-years-resolutions-im-not-doing-it-anymore-im-just-gonna-be-my-best/>, New Year’s resolutions offer a chance for anyone to start the year with a clean slate and define their ambitions for the coming months. Business leaders are certainly no exception.\n\nI reached out to the CHROs from 10 companies, including Estée Lauder, Papa Johns, and Walmart, asking them to share their hopes for 2024, and what they plan to focus their energies on. \n\nTheir answers ran the gamut, from providing better support for middle managers, to concentrating on retaining talent. Several themes echoed across resolutions as a whole, including better investment into AI, emphasizing employee wellbeing, and improving employee learning and skills development. \n\nCori Davis, the chief people officer at biotechnology company Genentech, took a big picture approach to her resolution, and noted that the last several years have been difficult for everyone. Her goal is to “bring more joy and energy into the workplace.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/01/08/hr-leaders-new-years-resolutions-2024/\n\nSource 7:\nAnd that was before the stock market set fresh record highs over the past week as new inflation data <https://fortune.com/2024/07/11/inflation-consumer-price-index-drop-interest-rate-cuts/> gave the Federal Reserve more leeway to cut rates in the near future and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sounded increasingly dovish <https://fortune.com/2024/07/09/economic-outlook-fed-chair-jerome-powell-warns-inflation-risk/>.\n\nThe surge of interest in single stocks comes as stock-picking has been overshadowed by passive investing in recent years, with funds that track indexes like the S&P 500 drawing more and more capital while actively managed funds continue to underperform the market <https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/sp500-vs-actively-managed-funds-outperformance-buying-holding-passive-index-investing/>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/13/stock-market-investing-buying-single-record-pace-sp500-beating-bets-lowest-ever/\n\nSource 8:\nMuch like the list of newcomers of 2023 <https://fortune.com/2023/06/05/airbnb-silicon-valley-bank-new-fortune-500-companies/>, when Silicon Valley Bank <https://fortune.com/company/svb-financial-group/> made its debut after its March collapse, the embattled NYCB <https://www.investopedia.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-new-york-community-bank-troubles-8603112> makes its first appearance on the list this year with a reported 2023 revenue of $8.2 billion. \n\nThe biggest leap among the newcomers belongs to EchoStar <https://fortune.com/company/echostar/>. Despite not having a Fortune 1000 ranking last year, the satellite and internet service provider sits in the No. 242 position of the 2024 Fortune 500. EchoStar is also the newcomer with the biggest revenue increase, reaching $17 billion. \n\nLearn more about the 2024 Fortune 500 newcomers below.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/fortune-500-newcomers-doordash-monster-energy-intuitive-surgical-echostar-nycb/\n\nSource 9:\nThe declines come after the S&P 500 hit 38 new all-time highs in 2024, putting the stocks gauge on pace for the second most closing highs in about 100 years, Rubner wrote, adding that only 1995 is shaping up to be stronger.\n\nAfter that winning streak, stocks are left exposed to the weak inflows and remain vulnerable to negative headlines. There are no predicted inflows in August from passive investors or mutual funds as capital has already been deployed for the third quarter, Rubner said. As for trend-following systematic funds, positioning has reached maximum length, indicating there’s no room for further buying. \n\nWhile some investors argue that strong earnings, a possible near-term interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, and the rising odds of Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential election would provide another boost for stocks, Rubner says they won’t be positive catalysts. \n\nSuch events are already getting priced into the market and the bar for earnings for the biggest technology stocks that drove market to record highs is remarkably high. “And by high, I mean they need to be great,” he wrote.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/17/goldman-sachs-top-strategist-precipice-of-a-summer-correction/\n\nSource 10:\nAnd Buffett said because Abel understands businesses so well, he also understands stocks.\n\nBut Edward Jones <https://fortune.com/company/jones-financial/> analyst James Shanahan said a good business doesn\'t always make a good stock unless you get the timing and position size right, and there is an art to that.\n\n"I think stock picking is hard. I don’t think it’s something you can just start doing and be good at it," Shanahan said.\n\nAbel does have a history of making multibillion-dollar deals when he was the head of Berkshire\'s utility unit for a decade, including the acquisitions of NV Energy <https://apnews.com/41a0d2fb98e64e18aec6c8525886a34d> and AltaLink <https://apnews.com/bafaf7f961f44fbab6f07287812cca0b>, but he\'s never been a stock picker. Weschler and Combs might be able to help Abel get the timing right and find opportunities in the stock market, but Buffett didn\'t say that Saturday.\n\nAbel just reassured shareholders that "the capital allocation principles that we use today will be maintained.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/05/warren-buffett-succession-greg-abel-berkshire-hathaway-investment-portfolio-stock-picker/'}

Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, expects greater depth and diversity in the S&P 500 in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies [1].

According to Mukherjee, interest rates are likely to fall through the year as the Fed becomes less hawkish and inflation continues to decline alongside moderate economic growth [1]. This could lead to a positive return in the stock market, with some experts anticipating a repeat of the 2023 rally [2].

In terms of specific stocks, the so-called "Magnificent Seven" - Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) - have driven much of the S&P 500's returns in 2023 [1]. Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, expects greater depth and diversity in the S&P 500 in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies [1].

2024-11-07 23:07:41,345: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What are the best stock picks for 2024?

2024-11-07 23:07:41,345: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: While it's difficult to pinpoint a single "best" stock pick for 2024, experts and analysts have identified certain trends and companies that could perform well in the coming year. According to Mukherjee, interest rates are likely to fall through the year as the Fed becomes less hawkish and inflation continues to decline alongside moderate economic growth [1]. This could lead to a positive return in the stock market, with some experts anticipating a repeat of the 2023 rally [2].

In terms of specific stocks, the so-called "Magnificent Seven" - Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) - have driven much of the S&P 500's returns in 2023 [1]. Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, expects greater depth and diversity in the S&P 500 in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies [1]. He also thinks midcaps could outperform large cap stocks. Additionally, AI chip supplier Nvidia has led the index with a 239% gain in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimates that AI investment could reach as high as $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

It's worth noting that the stock market has already seen significant gains in 2024, with the S&P 500 up about 12% year-to-date [3]. Some of the biggest players in AI, like Nvidia and Microsoft, have seen their shares continue to soar in 2024. However, it's always important to do your own research and consider multiple perspectives before making any investment decisions.

Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, expects greater depth and diversity in the S&P 500 in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies [1]. He also thinks midcaps could outperform large cap stocks. Additionally, AI chip supplier Nvidia has led the index with a 239% gain in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimates that AI investment could reach as high as $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

It's worth noting that the stock market has already seen significant gains in 2024, with the S&P 500 up about 12% year-to-date [3]. Some of the biggest players in AI, like Nvidia and Microsoft, have seen their shares continue to soar in 2024. However, it's always important to do your own research and consider multiple perspectives before making any investment decisions.

2024-11-07 23:07:41,359: ObserveEventsHandler(  207): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd response: assistant: While it's difficult to pinpoint a single "best" stock pick for 2024, experts and analysts have identified certain trends and companies that could perform well in the coming year. According to Mukherjee, interest rates are likely to fall through the year as the Fed becomes less hawkish and inflation continues to decline alongside moderate economic growth [1]. This could lead to a positive return in the stock market, with some experts anticipating a repeat of the 2023 rally [2].
