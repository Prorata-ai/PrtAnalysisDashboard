Paul Getty Trust, which funds education programs, research, preservation, grants, and iconic Los Angeles museums. In addition to providing beauty, expression and opportunities to connect on a deep level, she notes that creating and consuming art is tied to wellness. “It makes us happy. It makes it possible for us to express emotion,” she said, “We know that looking at art reduces your blood pressure and gives you an endorphin rush.”\n\nAnd, of course, it’s an investment. When I asked what each would do if someone gave them $100 million, Horowitz paused. “We\'re a business that\'s almost intentionally chaotic to create a moment of urgency,” he said. “What would an institution of permanence look like, where could we support and service the sense of place that the Getty has?”\n\nAnd Fleming? “I’d be delighted to put their name on a fabulous new education facility around art for K-12 education,” she says. “Culture is core to the most fundamental form of human success.” \n\nMore news below.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/31/halloween-in-saudi-arabia/\n\nSource 1:\nThere’s been plenty of debate about geopolitics in the halls of the FII Institute <https://fii-institute.org/conference/fii8/>.

In some places this sort of persuasion might seem unnecessary—perhaps even self-indulgent. But Kreidler says it\'s needed here. "We could have created a PowerPoint show. But interactive media is the vernacular of Silicon Valley. A lot of the people we\'re trying to reach play games—computer games. It\'s part of their culture." Kreidler goes on to make the sort of good-for-bidness culture pitch that was familiar to residents of Texas in the oil-boom days—evidence that arts are a hard sell here. Just ask Sally Osberg.

Happily for dealers, art prices seem spurred on equally by either a sagging or a surging stock market. When the Dow <https://fortune.com/company/dow/> Jones is down, masterpieces still look like a safe bet for long-term appreciation. When the Dow moves up, wealthier investors tend to cash in some of their capital gains and splurge on art. As a result, Sotheby Parke Bernet in New York saw its 1977 fall sales shoot up 53 percent. This spring the auction house installed a theater-style revolving stage so the bidding could proceed even faster.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/getty-museum-malibu/\n\nSource 4:\n“I think they develop an interest for Nordic art,” Tangen told Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/from-atlanta-to-dc-infill-subway-stations-are-closing-transit-gaps>, referring to international visitors. “I hope it will increase the competition in the museum world in Norway. I would love this to be like a small irritating mosquito, which just puts on the best exhibitions, so people in Oslo are like, ‘Geez, what’s going on in this town?’” \n\nThe Norges Bank CEO has been collecting art for close to 35 years. In picking his art, Tangen follows the advice he gives the fund’s traders—think contrarian. Instead of buying newer art that enters the market, he buys works over 50 years old to see their store of value over time.\n\nKunstsilo, once home to 15,000 tons of grain, is now the gallery with the world\'s comprehensive collection of Nordic modern art.\n\n“It was always meant to be a museum-like collection, which means that you want to have the most important artists and you want to have the most important work,” Tangen said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/09/norwegian-wealth-fund-ceo-nicolai-tangen-grain-silo-art-display-tourism-kristiansand/\n\nSource 5:\nWhile artists hone their craft over years of practice, often spending time and money on schooling, supplies, books, and tutorials, the study found, AI companies are “using their works without compensation while raising billions from venture capitalists to compete with them in the same market.” The inherent inequality of this relationship, the study states, means that power over how generative AI operates could end up centralized in the hands of a few corporations in Western nations, “while disenfranchising artists around the world.” \n\nAccording to 2022 data <https://www.americansforthearts.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/Artists%20in%20Workforce%202023%20%282022%20data%29.pdf> from the U.S Census Bureau, about 2.6 million Americans are employed as artists, which the federal government defines by a handful of occupations, including architects, fine artists, animators, designers, actors, dancers, photographers, and others. The unemployment rate for artists in 2022 was 3.9%, up from 3.7% in 2019–and is relatively higher than other professional workers who generally require college training, which has an unemployment rate of about 2%.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/apple-ipad-crush-tiktok-artists-tools-hype-ipad/\n\nSource 5:\nAI, which uses machine learning-based image generators with an ability to “output consistently higher quality images,” has been capturing the nation’s attention for the last several years, with its ability to easily recreate photos into pretty much anything. Your selfie can easily be transformed <https://www.perfectcorp.com/consumer/blog/photo-editing/ai-trends-photography> into an air-brushed goddess version of you, or recreated in the painting style of Van Gogh. In fact, generative AI art is an estimated $48 billion industry, the study found. \n\nIt’s important to note for AI to transform you, it first needs to input material into its learning model, and such material is often made by humans. As it turns out, that’s one of the very areas artists are concerned about.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/apple-ipad-crush-tiktok-artists-tools-hype-ipad/\n\nSource 6:\n“The retention and strong utilization is reflected in the balances outstanding, which have remained strong,” he said.\n\nBank of America structures these loans on a variable rate, so over time the cost of capital could decrease if rates fall. The interest rate is based on the secured overnight financing rate, plus a spread, Watson said. So as rates get cut, loans like this are even more likely to increase.\n\nCitigroup <https://fortune.com/company/citigroup/>, which estimates its share of the market at 10% to 15%, has a steady base of art-lending clients because rates on art loans are still favorable compared to other loans, according to Fotini Xydas, head of art finance at Citi Private Bank. \n\n“Even though rates are higher, art is a very stable asset over the long term, compared to other assets in terms of volatility,” she said. \n\nArt loans function as lines of credit, so clients draw on them and pay them back as they can.

In fact, generative AI art is an estimated $48 billion industry, the study found. \n\nIt’s important to note for AI to transform you, it first needs to input material into its learning model, and such material is often made by humans.

It makes it possible for us to express emotion,” she said, “We know that looking at art reduces your blood pressure and gives you an endorphin rush.”\n\nAnd, of course, it’s an investment. When I asked what each would do if someone gave them $100 million, Horowitz paused. “We\'re a business that\'s almost intentionally chaotic to create a moment of urgency,” he said. “What would an institution of permanence look like, where could we support and service the sense of place that the Getty has?”\n\nAnd Fleming? “I’d be delighted to put their name on a fabulous new education facility around art for K-12 education,” she says. “Culture is core to the most fundamental form of human success.” \n\nMore news below.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/31/halloween-in-saudi-arabia/\n\nSource 1:\nThere’s been plenty of debate about geopolitics in the halls of the FII Institute <https://fii-institute.org/conference/fii8/>.

2024-11-08 12:32:46,943: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Art has a profound impact on culture because it has the power to express emotions, spark creativity, and bring people together. As Katherine Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, notes, "creating and consuming art is tied to wellness" [1]. Art has the ability to make us happy, allow us to express emotions, and even reduce our blood pressure and give us an endorphin rush [1]. This emotional connection is a key reason why art has such a profound impact on culture.

Art also has the power to inspire innovation and drive growth. As Noah Horowitz, CEO of Art Basel, explains, art can "create inspiring moments of connectivity and ultimately transform cities" [1]. This is evident in the success of art fairs like Art Basel, which hosts annual events in Basel, Hong Kong, Paris, and Miami Beach, and has become a major driver of cultural and economic growth in these cities [1]. Furthermore, art can also serve as a source of cultural identity and pride, as seen in the efforts of Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank, to create a museum-like collection of Nordic modern art in Kristiansand, Norway [4].

In addition, art has the ability to bring people together and create a sense of community. As Peter T.

2024-11-08 12:32:47,234: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Art has a profound impact on culture because it has the power to express emotions, spark creativity, and bring people together. As Katherine Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, notes, "creating and consuming art is tied to wellness" [1]. Art has the ability to make us happy, allow us to express emotions, and even reduce our blood pressure and give us an endorphin rush [1]. This emotional connection is a key reason why art has such a profound impact on culture.

Art also has the power to inspire innovation and drive growth. As Noah Horowitz, CEO of Art Basel, explains, art can "create inspiring moments of connectivity and ultimately transform cities" [1]. This is evident in the success of art fairs like Art Basel, which hosts annual events in Basel, Hong Kong, Paris, and Miami Beach, and has become a major driver of cultural and economic growth in these cities [1]. Furthermore, art can also serve as a source of cultural identity and pride, as seen in the efforts of Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank, to create a museum-like collection of Nordic modern art in Kristiansand, Norway [4].

In addition, art has the ability to bring people together and create a sense of community. As Peter T. Coleman, a professor of psychology and education at Columbia University, notes, cultural values need to resonate with employees during critical times, and art can play a key role in fostering this sense of community and shared values [7]. Moreover, research has shown that engaging with art can even have

2024-11-08 12:32:47,360: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Art has a profound impact on culture because it has the power to express emotions, spark creativity, and bring people together. As Katherine Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, notes, "creating and consuming art is tied to wellness" [1]. Art has the ability to make us happy, allow us to express emotions, and even reduce our blood pressure and give us an endorphin rush [1]. This emotional connection is a key reason why art has such a profound impact on culture.

Art also has the power to inspire innovation and drive growth. As Noah Horowitz, CEO of Art Basel, explains, art can "create inspiring moments of connectivity and ultimately transform cities" [1]. This is evident in the success of art fairs like Art Basel, which hosts annual events in Basel, Hong Kong, Paris, and Miami Beach, and has become a major driver of cultural and economic growth in these cities [1]. Furthermore, art can also serve as a source of cultural identity and pride, as seen in the efforts of Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank, to create a museum-like collection of Nordic modern art in Kristiansand, Norway [4].

In addition, art has the ability to bring people together and create a sense of community. As Peter T. Coleman, a professor of psychology and education at Columbia University, notes, cultural values need to resonate with employees during critical times, and art can play a key role in fostering this sense of community and shared values [7]. Moreover, research has shown that engaging with art can even have a positive impact on our physical and cognitive health, with studies suggesting that it can improve attention and ultimately

Furthermore, art can also serve as a source of cultural identity and pride, as seen in the efforts of Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank, to create a museum-like collection of Nordic modern art in Kristiansand, Norway [4].

In addition, art has the ability to bring people together and create a sense of community. As Peter T. Coleman, a professor of psychology and education at Columbia University, notes, cultural values need to resonate with employees during critical times, and art can play a key role in fostering this sense of community and shared values [7]. Moreover, research has shown that engaging with art can even have a positive impact on our physical and cognitive health, with studies suggesting that it can improve attention and ultimately lengthen one's lifespan [8]. Overall, art's profound impact on culture is due to its ability to inspire, connect, and uplift people, making it a vital part

2024-11-08 12:32:47,608: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Art has a profound impact on culture because it has the power to express emotions, spark creativity, and bring people together. As Katherine Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, notes, "creating and consuming art is tied to wellness" [1]. Art has the ability to make us happy, allow us to express emotions, and even reduce our blood pressure and give us an endorphin rush [1]. This emotional connection is a key reason why art has such a profound impact on culture.

Art also has the power to inspire innovation and drive growth. As Noah Horowitz, CEO of Art Basel, explains, art can "create inspiring moments of connectivity and ultimately transform cities" [1]. This is evident in the success of art fairs like Art Basel, which hosts annual events in Basel, Hong Kong, Paris, and Miami Beach, and has become a major driver of cultural and economic growth in these cities [1]. Furthermore, art can also serve as a source of cultural identity and pride, as seen in the efforts of Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank, to create a museum-like collection of Nordic modern art in Kristiansand, Norway [4].

In addition, art has the ability to bring people together and create a sense of community. As Peter T. Coleman, a professor of psychology and education at Columbia University, notes, cultural values need to resonate with employees during critical times, and art can play a key role in fostering this sense of community and shared values [7]. Moreover, research has shown that engaging with art can even have a positive impact on our physical and cognitive health, with studies suggesting that it can improve attention and ultimately lengthen one's lifespan [8]. Overall, art's profound impact on culture is due to its ability to inspire, connect, and uplift people, making it a vital part of our shared human experience.

This emotional connection is a key reason why art has such a profound impact on culture.

Art also has the power to inspire innovation and drive growth. As Noah Horowitz, CEO of Art Basel, explains, art can "create inspiring moments of connectivity and ultimately transform cities" [1]. This is evident in the success of art fairs like Art Basel, which hosts annual events in Basel, Hong Kong, Paris, and Miami Beach, and has become a major driver of cultural and economic growth in these cities [1]. Furthermore, art can also serve as a source of cultural identity and pride, as seen in the efforts of Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank, to create a museum-like collection of Nordic modern art in Kristiansand, Norway [4].

In addition, art has the ability to bring people together and create a sense of community. As Peter T. Coleman, a professor of psychology and education at Columbia University, notes, cultural values need to resonate with employees during critical times, and art can play a key role in fostering this sense of community and shared values [7]. Moreover, research has shown that engaging with art can even have a positive impact on our physical and cognitive health, with studies suggesting that it can improve attention and ultimately lengthen one's lifespan [8]. Overall, art's profound impact on culture is due to its ability to inspire, connect, and uplift people, making it a vital part of our shared human experience.
