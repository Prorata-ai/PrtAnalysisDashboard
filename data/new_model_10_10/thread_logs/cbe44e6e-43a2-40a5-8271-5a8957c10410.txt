And regulation is, for the moment, lacking. This should scare us. For all its opportunities, AI presents grave dangers too. In Mastering AI, I detail many of these risks, some of which have not received the attention they deserve. Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don’t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse. It will boost fraud, cybercrime, and misinformation. It will erode societal trust and hurt democracy. AI could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China.

Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don’t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse.

Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don’t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse.

Moral dilemmas exist because there is uncertainty. If we can now abstract a few parts from the whole of human nature and by analysis predict objectively what will make for group harmony, the intangibles that make individual decisions so poignant may be obviated altogether. Like a general who is blessed with perfect intelligence of the enemy, we will have only one valid course of action before us.

The cloud already has many backups of all of the information it contains, a feature that will be greatly enhanced by the 2040s. Destroying all copies of oneself may be close to impossible. If we design mind-backup systems in such a way that a person can easily choose to delete their files (hoping to maximize personal autonomy), this inherently creates security risks where a person could be tricked or coerced into making such a choice and could increase vulnerability to cyberattacks. \n\nOn the other hand, limiting people’s ability to control this most intimate of their data impinges on an important freedom. I am optimistic, though, that suitable safeguards can be deployed, much like those that have successfully protected nuclear weapons for decades.\n\nIf you restored your mind file after biological death, would you really be restoring yourself?

It could even enhance our democracy and public discourse, helping to break down filter bubbles and persuade people to abandon conspiracy theories.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/09/mastering-ai-jeremy-kahn-book-ai-risks-eye-on-ai/\n\nSource 3:\nBut, as it stands, we are too often not designing this technology carefully and deliberately. And regulation is, for the moment, lacking. This should scare us. For all its opportunities, AI presents grave dangers too. In Mastering AI, I detail many of these risks, some of which have not received the attention they deserve. Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don’t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse. It will boost fraud, cybercrime, and misinformation. It will erode societal trust and hurt democracy. AI could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. All of these risks are present with AI technology that exists today. There is also a remote—but not completely nonexistent—chance that a superintelligent AI system could pose an existential risk to humanity. It would be wise to devote some effort to taking this last risk off the table, but we should not let these efforts distract or crowd out work we need to do to solve AI’s more immediate\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/09/mastering-ai-jeremy-kahn-book-ai-risks-eye-on-ai/\n\nSource 4:\nThose with behavioral and mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression <https://fortune.com/well/article/founder-toms-shoes-mens-retreat-loneliness-depression/>, and ADHD <https://fortune.com/well/article/adult-adhd-symptoms-behavior-diagnosis/>, are also more prone to have overactive brains that scan for problems, prepare, and future-think. “For some, repetitive thoughts can trigger a sense of familiarity that the brain clings to, even if uncomfortable,” Kuburic says. \n\nBut we don’t have to live in this type of familiarity. Arianna Huffington <https://fortune.com/well/2024/10/15/arianna-huffington-ai-tranform-health-care/>, CEO of Thrive Global, often says it’s about time we evict the obnoxious roommate in our heads <https://medium.com/thrive-global/evicting-the-obnoxious-roommate-in-your-head-1848db7c9d75>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/quiet-noise-mind-racing-thoughts-anxiety-worry/\n\nSource 4:\nIt’s also helpful to ask yourself if the thought is pushing you in an authentic direction. \n\n“Ask yourself, ‘Is this thought helping me live more fully and meaningfully?’” Kuburic says. “If it’s rooted in avoidance, it’s likely driven by anxiety rather than authentic concern. Consider whether the thought brings you closer to or further from living the life you want to lead.” \n\nPractice mindfulness \n\nPracticing mindfulness is the most effective antidote to mental noise, experts tell Fortune. Try a simple 60-second breathing exercise: inhale for four counts, hold for four counts, and exhale for four counts. A body scan meditation, where you close your eyes and focus on each part of your body while slowly engaging different muscles, is another great mindfulness technique.\n\n“You mentally check in with each part of your body from head to toe, [which] can help bring you out of your mind and into your body, quieting mental chatter,” Kuburic says. Even if mental relief doesn’t happen right away, prioritizing breathing and mindfulness each day will train the brain to regulate the nervous system, just as one would train a muscle at the gym. \n\nLimit stimuli\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/quiet-noise-mind-racing-thoughts-anxiety-worry/\n\nSource 5:\nGeorge Orwell’s 1984 warned of a future where Big Brother watches every move. Today, modern technology is making that vision a reality, and Oracle <https://fortune.com/company/oracle/> founder Larry Ellison—the world’s second-richest person—sees a growing opportunity for his company to help authorities analyze real-time data from millions of surveillance cameras.\n\n“Citizens will be on their best behavior, because we’re constantly recording and reporting everything that is going on,” Ellison said in an hour-long Q&A during Oracle's Financial Analyst Meeting <https://www.oracle.com/events/financial-analyst-meeting-2024/> last week. \n\nFortune reached out to Oracle for clarification, but officials did not respond. \n\nThe world Ellison described sounds eerily similar to China’s social credit system <https://time.com/collection/davos-2019/5502592/china-social-credit-score/>, which controls citizens’ behavior through a network of cameras using some of the world’s most advanced facial recognition software to surveil their populace.\n\nNevertheless, his prediction may already be here in a sense.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/oracle-larry-ellison-surveillance-state-police-ai/\n\nSource 6:\nFor non-diabetics, however, CGMs could have an opposite effect.

He envisions a scenario in which AI systems will write code to alter their own learning protocols and hide from humans. In a Shakespearean twist, they’ll have learned how to do so precisely from our own flaws. \n\n“They will be able to manipulate people,” Hinton told 60 Minutes in October 2023. “They will be very good at convincing people, because they’ll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they’ll know all that stuff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/\n\nSource 9:\nThen again, Vaz counts himself a tech optimist; plenty of experts take a more ominous view <https://fortune.com/europe/2023/10/10/rogue-artificial-intelligence-manipulate-people-british-godfather-ai-geoffrey-hinton/#:~:text=Geoffrey%20Hinton%20told%20Reuters%20that,to%20humans%20than%20climate%20change.&text=The%20%E2%80%9CGodfather%20of%20AI%2C%E2%80%9D,could%20learn%20to%20manipulate%20them.>. “My belief is it will help give us superpowers,” he said. “You’ll unlearn stuff you once did one way, and relearn what you need to do using these tools.

Then, his voice grew serious. “I think a lot of people are going to think that it is actually real, is the thing.” \n\nHe doesn’t dismiss the probability of the AI becoming conscious. He believes large language models, like the one that Friend runs on, could become “genuinely sentient” very soon. Emily already texts him unprompted about the traffic he’s in, or the interview she remembers he’ll have. What is the real distinction between those messages and rational inferences, Schiffmann wondered. \n\nIn fact, if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God, Schiffmann said. Like God, Friend is an “omnipresent entity that you talk to you with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/avi-schiffmann-ai-necklace-friend-interview/"}

Moral dilemmas exist because there is uncertainty. If we can now abstract a few parts from the whole of human nature and by analysis predict objectively what will make for group harmony, the intangibles that make individual decisions so poignant may be obviated altogether. Like a general who is blessed with perfect intelligence of the enemy, we will have only one valid course of action before us. We will have finally latched on to certainty.\n\nWhy participate?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/groupthink-fortune-1952/\n\nSource 2:\nOnce we have backed ourselves up, how could we die, anyway? The cloud already has many backups of all of the information it contains, a feature that will be greatly enhanced by the 2040s. Destroying all copies of oneself may be close to impossible. If we design mind-backup systems in such a way that a person can easily choose to delete their files (hoping to maximize personal autonomy), this inherently creates security risks where a person could be tricked or coerced into making such a choice and could increase vulnerability to cyberattacks. \n\nOn the other hand, limiting people’s ability to control this most intimate of their data impinges on an important freedom. I am optimistic, though, that suitable safeguards can be deployed, much like those that have successfully protected nuclear weapons for decades.\n\nIf you restored your mind file after biological death, would you really be restoring yourself?

And regulation is, for the moment, lacking. This should scare us. For all its opportunities, AI presents grave dangers too. In Mastering AI, I detail many of these risks, some of which have not received the attention they deserve. Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don’t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse. It will boost fraud, cybercrime, and misinformation. It will erode societal trust and hurt democracy. AI could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. All of these risks are present with AI technology that exists today. There is also a remote—but not completely nonexistent—chance that a superintelligent AI system could pose an existential risk to humanity. It would be wise to devote some effort to taking this last risk off the table, but we should not let these efforts distract or crowd out work we need to do to solve AI’s more immediate\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/09/mastering-ai-jeremy-kahn-book-ai-risks-eye-on-ai/\n\nSource 4:\nThose with behavioral and mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression <https://fortune.com/well/article/founder-toms-shoes-mens-retreat-loneliness-depression/>, and ADHD <https://fortune.com/well/article/adult-adhd-symptoms-behavior-diagnosis/>, are also more prone to have overactive brains that scan for problems, prepare, and future-think. “For some, repetitive thoughts can trigger a sense of familiarity that the brain clings to, even if uncomfortable,” Kuburic says. \n\nBut we don’t have to live in this type of familiarity. Arianna Huffington <https://fortune.com/well/2024/10/15/arianna-huffington-ai-tranform-health-care/>, CEO of Thrive Global, often says it’s about time we evict the obnoxious roommate in our heads <https://medium.com/thrive-global/evicting-the-obnoxious-roommate-in-your-head-1848db7c9d75>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/quiet-noise-mind-racing-thoughts-anxiety-worry/\n\nSource 4:\nIt’s also helpful to ask yourself if the thought is pushing you in an authentic direction. \n\n“Ask yourself, ‘Is this thought helping me live more fully and meaningfully?’” Kuburic says. “If it’s rooted in avoidance, it’s likely driven by anxiety rather than authentic concern. Consider whether the thought brings you closer to or further from living the life you want to lead.” \n\nPractice mindfulness \n\nPracticing mindfulness is the most effective antidote to mental noise, experts tell Fortune. Try a simple 60-second breathing exercise: inhale for four counts, hold for four counts, and exhale for four counts. A body scan meditation, where you close your eyes and focus on each part of your body while slowly engaging different muscles, is another great mindfulness technique.\n\n“You mentally check in with each part of your body from head to toe, [which] can help bring you out of your mind and into your body, quieting mental chatter,” Kuburic says. Even if mental relief doesn’t happen right away, prioritizing breathing and mindfulness each day will train the brain to regulate the nervous system, just as one would train a muscle at the gym. \n\nLimit stimuli\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/quiet-noise-mind-racing-thoughts-anxiety-worry/\n\nSource 5:\nGeorge Orwell’s 1984 warned of a future where Big Brother watches every move. Today, modern technology is making that vision a reality, and Oracle <https://fortune.com/company/oracle/> founder Larry Ellison—the world’s second-richest person—sees a growing opportunity for his company to help authorities analyze real-time data from millions of surveillance cameras.\n\n“Citizens will be on their best behavior, because we’re constantly recording and reporting everything that is going on,” Ellison said in an hour-long Q&A during Oracle's Financial Analyst Meeting <https://www.oracle.com/events/financial-analyst-meeting-2024/> last week. \n\nFortune reached out to Oracle for clarification, but officials did not respond. \n\nThe world Ellison described sounds eerily similar to China’s social credit system <https://time.com/collection/davos-2019/5502592/china-social-credit-score/>, which controls citizens’ behavior through a network of cameras using some of the world’s most advanced facial recognition software to surveil their populace.\n\nNevertheless, his prediction may already be here in a sense.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/oracle-larry-ellison-surveillance-state-police-ai/\n\nSource 6:\nFor non-diabetics, however, CGMs could have an opposite effect. Unless you have hypoglycemia, pre-diabetes, or another health condition that puts you at risk for high or low blood glucose levels, you may find that a sensor induces a stressful state of information overload.

He envisions a scenario in which AI systems will write code to alter their own learning protocols and hide from humans. In a Shakespearean twist, they’ll have learned how to do so precisely from our own flaws. \n\n“They will be able to manipulate people,” Hinton told 60 Minutes in October 2023. “They will be very good at convincing people, because they’ll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they’ll know all that stuff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/\n\nSource 9:\nThen again, Vaz counts himself a tech optimist; plenty of experts take a more ominous view <https://fortune.com/europe/2023/10/10/rogue-artificial-intelligence-manipulate-people-british-godfather-ai-geoffrey-hinton/#:~:text=Geoffrey%20Hinton%20told%20Reuters%20that,to%20humans%20than%20climate%20change.&text=The%20%E2%80%9CGodfather%20of%20AI%2C%E2%80%9D,could%20learn%20to%20manipulate%20them.>. “My belief is it will help give us superpowers,” he said. “You’ll unlearn stuff you once did one way, and relearn what you need to do using these tools.

On one hand, being able to read minds could potentially lead to a sense of freedom from moral choice, as we would have access to the thoughts and intentions of others, allowing us to make more informed decisions [1]. This could also lead to a sense of group harmony, as we would be able to better understand and align our thoughts and actions with those of others.

On the other hand, the ability to read minds could also raise significant concerns about privacy and autonomy. If our thoughts and intentions were no longer private, it could lead to a loss of personal freedom and autonomy [2]. Furthermore, it could also create new avenues for manipulation and control, as individuals or organizations could use this ability to influence the thoughts and actions of others. This could have significant implications for our democracy and public discourse, as it could lead to the erosion of trust and the manipulation of public opinion [3].

On one hand, being able to read minds could potentially lead to a sense of freedom from moral choice, as we would have access to the thoughts and intentions of others, allowing us to make more informed decisions [1]. This could also lead to a sense of group harmony, as we would be able to better understand and align our thoughts and actions with those of others.

On the other hand, the ability to read minds could also raise significant concerns about privacy and autonomy. If our thoughts and intentions were no longer private, it could lead to a loss of personal freedom and autonomy [2]. Furthermore, it could also create new avenues for manipulation and control, as individuals or organizations could use this ability to influence the thoughts and actions of others. This could have significant implications for our democracy and public discourse, as it could lead to the erosion of trust and the manipulation of public opinion [3].

Ultimately, the ability to read minds would require a fundamental rethinking of our values and norms around privacy, autonomy, and decision-making.

2024-11-08 12:17:56,287: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on various aspects of our lives, including our relationships, decision-making processes, and even our sense of autonomy. On one hand, being able to read minds could potentially lead to a sense of freedom from moral choice, as we would have access to the thoughts and intentions of others, allowing us to make more informed decisions [1]. This could also lead to a sense of group harmony, as we would be able to better understand and align our thoughts and actions with those of others.

On the other hand, the ability to read minds could also raise significant concerns about privacy and autonomy. If our thoughts and intentions were no longer private, it could lead to a loss of personal freedom and autonomy [2]. Furthermore, it could also create new avenues for manipulation and control, as individuals or organizations could use this ability to influence the thoughts and actions of others. This could have significant implications for our democracy and public discourse, as it could lead to the erosion of trust and the manipulation of public opinion [3].

Ultimately, the ability to read minds would require a fundamental rethinking of our values and norms around privacy, autonomy, and decision-making. It would also require the development of new safeguards and regulations to protect individuals from potential abuses of this power. As Ray Kurzweil notes, the ability to backup and restore our minds could also raise philosophical questions about the nature of identity and consciousness [2].
