It makes it possible for us to express emotion,” she said, “We know that looking at art reduces your blood pressure and gives you an endorphin rush.”\n\nAnd, of course, it’s an investment. When I asked what each would do if someone gave them $100 million, Horowitz paused. “We're a business that's almost intentionally chaotic to create a moment of urgency,” he said. “What would an institution of permanence look like, where could we support and service the sense of place that the Getty has?”\n\nAnd Fleming? “I’d be delighted to put their name on a fabulous new education facility around art for K-12 education,” she says. “Culture is core to the most fundamental form of human success.” \n\nMore news below.", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.64722586), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='c0c45144-5f68-4e08-b03c-0885fbfc2687', embedding=None, metadata={'id': '0342e647e8bfa347594068ff363a86070b1f6a5c0dad1326c93ecbef83fba1b6-9', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': '0342e647e8bfa347594068ff363a86070b1f6a5c0dad1326c93ecbef83fba1b6', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20001127, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-08', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/peterhero1.jpeg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2000, 'date_month': 11, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/article/peter-hero-silicon-valley-giving/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 27, 'title': 'The man who sold Silicon Valley on giving', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/article/peter-hero-silicon-valley-giving/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='the arts.

What felt fresh were conversations about investing in arts and culture as a source of wellness, innovation and resilient growth. Anyone who has been to the historic city of Diriyah <https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/diriyah> or read Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 <https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en> knows that the goal is to create a global hub that embraces the old and the new <https://www.sacm.org/ksa/culture>.\n\nCulture is also big business. Witness the success of Art Basel <https://www.artbasel.com/?lang=en>, which hosts annual art fairs in Basel, Hong Kong, Paris and Miami Beach. “We exist to power the careers of artists,” said CEO Noah Horowitz, “but also create inspiring moments of connectivity and ultimately transform cities … developing local ecosystems that can fundamentally shift people’s views of the society in which they live.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/31/halloween-in-saudi-arabia/\n\nSource 1:\nI also spoke with Katherine Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, which funds education programs, research, preservation, grants, and iconic Los Angeles museums. In addition to providing beauty, expression and opportunities to connect on a deep level, she notes that creating and consuming art is tied to wellness. “It makes us happy. It makes it possible for us to express emotion,” she said, “We know that looking at art reduces your blood pressure and gives you an endorphin rush.”\n\nAnd, of course, it’s an investment. When I asked what each would do if someone gave them $100 million, Horowitz paused. “We\'re a business that\'s almost intentionally chaotic to create a moment of urgency,” he said. “What would an institution of permanence look like, where could we support and service the sense of place that the Getty has?”\n\nAnd Fleming? “I’d be delighted to put their name on a fabulous new education facility around art for K-12 education,” she says. “Culture is core to the most fundamental form of human success.” \n\nMore news below.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/31/halloween-in-saudi-arabia/\n\nSource 2:\nthe arts. How you spend it will determine whether Silicon Valley can attain "the sustained cultural heights of Renaissance Florence." The product of seven months\' labor—and $250,000 worth of foundation grants and donated services from the likes of Apple <https://fortune.com/company/apple/> (AAPL), Adobe <https://fortune.com/company/adobe-systems/>, and the games division of Lucas Arts—the game is aimed, says John Kreidler, the group\'s executive director, at getting some 1,000 area leaders "engaged in the idea that culture is important." In some places this sort of persuasion might seem unnecessary—perhaps even self-indulgent. But Kreidler says it\'s needed here. "We could have created a PowerPoint show. But interactive media is the vernacular of Silicon Valley. A lot of the people we\'re trying to reach play games—computer games. It\'s part of their culture." Kreidler goes on to make the sort of good-for-bidness culture pitch that was familiar to residents of Texas in the oil-boom days—evidence that arts are a hard sell here. Just ask Sally Osberg. As executive director of the Children\'s Discovery <https://fortune.com/company/discovery-insurance/> Museum in San\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/peter-hero-silicon-valley-giving/\n\nSource 2:\nWhat will be the fate of Silicon Valley?" intones a voice-over from the big screen in front of us. "Will we join the pantheon of cities that history has judged as creating true belles époques of human enterprise"—cities like Paris and Constantinople—or, the voice asks, will Silicon Valley become "just another boomtown that went bust?" I am seated at a large U-shaped conference table at the McKinsey <https://fortune.com/company/mckinsey/> & Co. offices in Palo Alto, along with two dozen members of a civic group called Cultural Initiatives Silicon Valley. Sleek black laptops, loaded and fired up, sit in front of us. We are here to be introduced to the group\'s new plan for convincing area leaders that culture is important. It is..a CD-ROM game. The game—catchily titled "is.C3: Creating a Great Region Through Commerce, Culture & Community"—is a simulation. It goes like this: Bruce Largecap, a major Silicon Valley tycoon, has been run over by a Mercedes SUV at the tender age of 44, leaving behind a $500 million endowment to support the arts.

The novel field of neuroaesthetics suggests that anything from listening to an opera to watching ballet to observing a painting can improve attention and ultimately lengthen one’s lifespan. “Those forms of beauty have a really beneficial impact on us,” Swart says. \n\nA fresh spin on aging\n\nResearch from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that people who have a positive view of aging tend to live longer and have better physical and cognitive health. \n\nMaddy Dychtwald, author of Ageless Aging, says there are a host of positives that come with climbing the chronological ladder, such as wisdom and self-acceptance. “We have agency that we never thought we had before,” she says. \n\nLesley Steinman, a research scientist in the health promotion research center at the University of Washington, cautions against using outdated terms, like “silver tsunami,” that perpetuate negative stereotypes about aging.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/2024/05/31/aging-sharp-mind-strategies/\n\nSource 4:\n“I think they develop an interest for Nordic art,” Tangen told Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/from-atlanta-to-dc-infill-subway-stations-are-closing-transit-gaps>, referring to international visitors. “I hope it will increase the competition in the museum world in Norway. I would love this to be like a small irritating mosquito, which just puts on the best exhibitions, so people in Oslo are like, ‘Geez, what’s going on in this town?’” \n\nThe Norges Bank CEO has been collecting art for close to 35 years. In picking his art, Tangen follows the advice he gives the fund’s traders—think contrarian. Instead of buying newer art that enters the market, he buys works over 50 years old to see their store of value over time.\n\nKunstsilo, once home to 15,000 tons of grain, is now the gallery with the world\'s comprehensive collection of Nordic modern art.\n\n“It was always meant to be a museum-like collection, which means that you want to have the most important artists and you want to have the most important work,” Tangen said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/09/norwegian-wealth-fund-ceo-nicolai-tangen-grain-silo-art-display-tourism-kristiansand/\n\nSource 5:\nManagers need clear expectations when it comes to culture. That means leaders must intentionally incorporate cultural values into communications, meetings, and even employee recognition, the research finds.\n\nCultural values also need to resonate with employees during critical times. For example, as the Nov. 5 presidential election draws near, political uncertainty is a top concern for business leaders. \n\nAnd the risk of politics disrupting the workplace is not hypothetical. A Gartner, Inc. survey released <https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-02-18-gartner-survey-shows-47--of-employees-report-being-di> in February 2020 found that 78% of employees reported discussing politics at work, and 47% reported that the U.S. 2020 presidential election had impacted their ability to get work done.\n\nWhen it comes to politics: “Unfortunately, what we are seeing is a trickle down into our homes and our workplace, where a large swath of Americans, recently, within the last couple of years, feel alienated from someone else,” according to Peter T. Coleman, a professor of psychology and education at Columbia University.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/25/how-good-leaders-help-managers-connect-employees-company-culture/\n\nSource 6:\nThe booming U.S. art market is recording annual sales estimated at $5 billion to $6 billion and growing approximately 20 percent a year. Happily for dealers, art prices seem spurred on equally by either a sagging or a surging stock market. When the Dow <https://fortune.com/company/dow/> Jones is down, masterpieces still look like a safe bet for long-term appreciation. When the Dow moves up, wealthier investors tend to cash in some of their capital gains and splurge on art. As a result, Sotheby Parke Bernet in New York saw its 1977 fall sales shoot up 53 percent. This spring the auction house installed a theater-style revolving stage so the bidding could proceed even faster.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/getty-museum-malibu/\n\nSource 7:\n“The retention and strong utilization is reflected in the balances outstanding, which have remained strong,” he said.\n\nBank of America structures these loans on a variable rate, so over time the cost of capital could decrease if rates fall. The interest rate is based on the secured overnight financing rate, plus a spread, Watson said. So as rates get cut, loans like this are even more likely to increase.\n\nCitigroup <https://fortune.com/company/citigroup/>, which estimates its share of the market at 10% to 15%, has a steady base of art-lending clients because rates on art loans are still favorable compared to other loans, according to Fotini Xydas, head of art finance at Citi Private Bank. \n\n“Even though rates are higher, art is a very stable asset over the long term, compared to other assets in terms of volatility,” she said. \n\nArt loans function as lines of credit, so clients draw on them and pay them back as they can. They’re only available to the wealthy, given the nature of the collateral. The larger the collection, the more flexibility there is for the borrowers.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/16/rich-art-market-collateral-cash-loan-debt/\n\nSource 7:\nThe global art market has cooled from record-high valuations coming out of the pandemic. Even as sales have slumped and values have pulled back, demand for art loans is there.\n\nBank of America has seen new credit lines backed by art rise more than 14% compared to a year ago, according to Drew Watson, head of art services. Its book of art loans recently hit its highest on record. Within JPMorgan’s asset and wealth management business, art lending is up 1% year-over-year, in-line with other loans in that business, according to a spokesperson.\n\n“Even in a higher rate environment, people are still taking advantage of timely opportunities,” taking out loans on their art over selling it at a discount, or selling stock, Watson said. \n\nBank of America, since it formed its art services group in 2017, has grown to capture over 30% market share, according to a spokesperson. The team, which the bank is continuing to invest in, has 12 specialists in the art market across credit, wealth planning and philanthropy.

Anyone who has been to the historic city of Diriyah <https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/diriyah> or read Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 <https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en> knows that the goal is to create a global hub that embraces the old and the new <https://www.sacm.org/ksa/culture>.\n\nCulture is also big business. Witness the success of Art Basel <https://www.artbasel.com/?lang=en>, which hosts annual art fairs in Basel, Hong Kong, Paris and Miami Beach. “We exist to power the careers of artists,” said CEO Noah Horowitz, “but also create inspiring moments of connectivity and ultimately transform cities … developing local ecosystems that can fundamentally shift people’s views of the society in which they live.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/31/halloween-in-saudi-arabia/\n\nSource 1:\nI also spoke with Katherine Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, which funds education programs, research, preservation, grants, and iconic Los Angeles museums. In addition to providing beauty, expression and opportunities to connect on a deep level, she notes that creating and consuming art is tied to wellness. “It makes us happy. It makes it possible for us to express emotion,” she said, “We know that looking at art reduces your blood pressure and gives you an endorphin rush.”\n\nAnd, of course, it’s an investment. When I asked what each would do if someone gave them $100 million, Horowitz paused. “We\'re a business that\'s almost intentionally chaotic to create a moment of urgency,” he said. “What would an institution of permanence look like, where could we support and service the sense of place that the Getty has?”\n\nAnd Fleming? “I’d be delighted to put their name on a fabulous new education facility around art for K-12 education,” she says. “Culture is core to the most fundamental form of human success.” \n\nMore news below.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/31/halloween-in-saudi-arabia/\n\nSource 2:\nthe arts.

The novel field of neuroaesthetics suggests that anything from listening to an opera to watching ballet to observing a painting can improve attention and ultimately lengthen one’s lifespan. “Those forms of beauty have a really beneficial impact on us,” Swart says. \n\nA fresh spin on aging\n\nResearch from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that people who have a positive view of aging tend to live longer and have better physical and cognitive health. \n\nMaddy Dychtwald, author of Ageless Aging, says there are a host of positives that come with climbing the chronological ladder, such as wisdom and self-acceptance. “We have agency that we never thought we had before,” she says. \n\nLesley Steinman, a research scientist in the health promotion research center at the University of Washington, cautions against using outdated terms, like “silver tsunami,” that perpetuate negative stereotypes about aging.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/2024/05/31/aging-sharp-mind-strategies/\n\nSource 4:\n“I think they develop an interest for Nordic art,” Tangen told Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/from-atlanta-to-dc-infill-subway-stations-are-closing-transit-gaps>, referring to international visitors. “I hope it will increase the competition in the museum world in Norway. I would love this to be like a small irritating mosquito, which just puts on the best exhibitions, so people in Oslo are like, ‘Geez, what’s going on in this town?’” \n\nThe Norges Bank CEO has been collecting art for close to 35 years. In picking his art, Tangen follows the advice he gives the fund’s traders—think contrarian. Instead of buying newer art that enters the market, he buys works over 50 years old to see their store of value over time.\n\nKunstsilo, once home to 15,000 tons of grain, is now the gallery with the world\'s comprehensive collection of Nordic modern art.\n\n“It was always meant to be a museum-like collection, which means that you want to have the most important artists and you want to have the most important work,” Tangen said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/09/norwegian-wealth-fund-ceo-nicolai-tangen-grain-silo-art-display-tourism-kristiansand/\n\nSource 5:\nManagers need clear expectations when it comes to culture. That means leaders must intentionally incorporate cultural values into communications, meetings, and even employee recognition, the research finds.\n\nCultural values also need to resonate with employees during critical times. For example, as the Nov. 5 presidential election draws near, political uncertainty is a top concern for business leaders. \n\nAnd the risk of politics disrupting the workplace is not hypothetical. A Gartner, Inc. survey released <https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-02-18-gartner-survey-shows-47--of-employees-report-being-di> in February 2020 found that 78% of employees reported discussing politics at work, and 47% reported that the U.S. 2020 presidential election had impacted their ability to get work done.\n\nWhen it comes to politics: “Unfortunately, what we are seeing is a trickle down into our homes and our workplace, where a large swath of Americans, recently, within the last couple of years, feel alienated from someone else,” according to Peter T. Coleman, a professor of psychology and education at Columbia University.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/25/how-good-leaders-help-managers-connect-employees-company-culture/\n\nSource 6:\nThe booming U.S. art market is recording annual sales estimated at $5 billion to $6 billion and growing approximately 20 percent a year. Happily for dealers, art prices seem spurred on equally by either a sagging or a surging stock market. When the Dow <https://fortune.com/company/dow/> Jones is down, masterpieces still look like a safe bet for long-term appreciation. When the Dow moves up, wealthier investors tend to cash in some of their capital gains and splurge on art. As a result, Sotheby Parke Bernet in New York saw its 1977 fall sales shoot up 53 percent. This spring the auction house installed a theater-style revolving stage so the bidding could proceed even faster.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/getty-museum-malibu/\n\nSource 7:\n“The retention and strong utilization is reflected in the balances outstanding, which have remained strong,” he said.\n\nBank of America structures these loans on a variable rate, so over time the cost of capital could decrease if rates fall. The interest rate is based on the secured overnight financing rate, plus a spread, Watson said. So as rates get cut, loans like this are even more likely to increase.\n\nCitigroup <https://fortune.com/company/citigroup/>, which estimates its share of the market at 10% to 15%, has a steady base of art-lending clients because rates on art loans are still favorable compared to other loans, according to Fotini Xydas, head of art finance at Citi Private Bank. \n\n“Even though rates are higher, art is a very stable asset over the long term, compared to other assets in terms of volatility,” she said. \n\nArt loans function as lines of credit, so clients draw on them and pay them back as they can. They’re only available to the wealthy, given the nature of the collateral. The larger the collection, the more flexibility there is for the borrowers.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/16/rich-art-market-collateral-cash-loan-debt/\n\nSource 7:\nThe global art market has cooled from record-high valuations coming out of the pandemic. Even as sales have slumped and values have pulled back, demand for art loans is there.\n\nBank of America has seen new credit lines backed by art rise more than 14% compared to a year ago, according to Drew Watson, head of art services. Its book of art loans recently hit its highest on record. Within JPMorgan’s asset and wealth management business, art lending is up 1% year-over-year, in-line with other loans in that business, according to a spokesperson.\n\n“Even in a higher rate environment, people are still taking advantage of timely opportunities,” taking out loans on their art over selling it at a discount, or selling stock, Watson said. \n\nBank of America, since it formed its art services group in 2017, has grown to capture over 30% market share, according to a spokesperson. The team, which the bank is continuing to invest in, has 12 specialists in the art market across credit, wealth planning and philanthropy. The bank’s clients that already have loans keep them, while utilization has remained around 70% this year, according to Watson.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/16/rich-art-market-collateral-cash-loan-debt/\n\nSource 8:\nIt seems younger wealthy individuals also have a different approach to sharing their assets in the future <https://fortune.com/2023/05/30/mr-beast-stunt-philanthropy-raising-money/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks>.

A Gartner, Inc. survey released <https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-02-18-gartner-survey-shows-47--of-employees-report-being-di> in February 2020 found that 78% of employees reported discussing politics at work, and 47% reported that the U.S. 2020 presidential election had impacted their ability to get work done.\n\nWhen it comes to politics: “Unfortunately, what we are seeing is a trickle down into our homes and our workplace, where a large swath of Americans, recently, within the last couple of years, feel alienated from someone else,” according to Peter T. Coleman, a professor of psychology and education at Columbia University.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/25/how-good-leaders-help-managers-connect-employees-company-culture/\n\nSource 6:\nThe booming U.S. art market is recording annual sales estimated at $5 billion to $6 billion and growing approximately 20 percent a year. Happily for dealers, art prices seem spurred on equally by either a sagging or a surging stock market. When the Dow <https://fortune.com/company/dow/> Jones is down, masterpieces still look like a safe bet for long-term appreciation. When the Dow moves up, wealthier investors tend to cash in some of their capital gains and splurge on art. As a result, Sotheby Parke Bernet in New York saw its 1977 fall sales shoot up 53 percent. This spring the auction house installed a theater-style revolving stage so the bidding could proceed even faster.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/getty-museum-malibu/\n\nSource 7:\n“The retention and strong utilization is reflected in the balances outstanding, which have remained strong,” he said.\n\nBank of America structures these loans on a variable rate, so over time the cost of capital could decrease if rates fall. The interest rate is based on the secured overnight financing rate, plus a spread, Watson said. So as rates get cut, loans like this are even more likely to increase.\n\nCitigroup <https://fortune.com/company/citigroup/>, which estimates its share of the market at 10% to 15%, has a steady base of art-lending clients because rates on art loans are still favorable compared to other loans, according to Fotini Xydas, head of art finance at Citi Private Bank. \n\n“Even though rates are higher, art is a very stable asset over the long term, compared to other assets in terms of volatility,” she said. \n\nArt loans function as lines of credit, so clients draw on them and pay them back as they can. They’re only available to the wealthy, given the nature of the collateral. The larger the collection, the more flexibility there is for the borrowers.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/16/rich-art-market-collateral-cash-loan-debt/\n\nSource 7:\nThe global art market has cooled from record-high valuations coming out of the pandemic. Even as sales have slumped and values have pulled back, demand for art loans is there.\n\nBank of America has seen new credit lines backed by art rise more than 14% compared to a year ago, according to Drew Watson, head of art services. Its book of art loans recently hit its highest on record. Within JPMorgan’s asset and wealth management business, art lending is up 1% year-over-year, in-line with other loans in that business, according to a spokesperson.\n\n“Even in a higher rate environment, people are still taking advantage of timely opportunities,” taking out loans on their art over selling it at a discount, or selling stock, Watson said. \n\nBank of America, since it formed its art services group in 2017, has grown to capture over 30% market share, according to a spokesperson. The team, which the bank is continuing to invest in, has 12 specialists in the art market across credit, wealth planning and philanthropy. The bank’s clients that already have loans keep them, while utilization has remained around 70% this year, according to Watson.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/16/rich-art-market-collateral-cash-loan-debt/\n\nSource 8:\nIt seems younger wealthy individuals also have a different approach to sharing their assets in the future <https://fortune.com/2023/05/30/mr-beast-stunt-philanthropy-raising-money/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks>.

What felt fresh were conversations about investing in arts and culture as a source of wellness, innovation and resilient growth. Anyone who has been to the historic city of Diriyah <https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/diriyah> or read Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 <https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en> knows that the goal is to create a global hub that embraces the old and the new <https://www.sacm.org/ksa/culture>.\n\nCulture is also big business. Witness the success of Art Basel <https://www.artbasel.com/?lang=en>, which hosts annual art fairs in Basel, Hong Kong, Paris and Miami Beach. “We exist to power the careers of artists,” said CEO Noah Horowitz, “but also create inspiring moments of connectivity and ultimately transform cities … developing local ecosystems that can fundamentally shift people’s views of the society in which they live.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/31/halloween-in-saudi-arabia/\n\nSource 1:\nI also spoke with Katherine Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, which funds education programs, research, preservation, grants, and iconic Los Angeles museums. In addition to providing beauty, expression and opportunities to connect on a deep level, she notes that creating and consuming art is tied to wellness. “It makes us happy. It makes it possible for us to express emotion,” she said, “We know that looking at art reduces your blood pressure and gives you an endorphin rush.”\n\nAnd, of course, it’s an investment. When I asked what each would do if someone gave them $100 million, Horowitz paused. “We\'re a business that\'s almost intentionally chaotic to create a moment of urgency,” he said. “What would an institution of permanence look like, where could we support and service the sense of place that the Getty has?”\n\nAnd Fleming? “I’d be delighted to put their name on a fabulous new education facility around art for K-12 education,” she says. “Culture is core to the most fundamental form of human success.” \n\nMore news below.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/31/halloween-in-saudi-arabia/\n\nSource 2:\nthe arts.

The product of seven months\' labor—and $250,000 worth of foundation grants and donated services from the likes of Apple <https://fortune.com/company/apple/> (AAPL), Adobe <https://fortune.com/company/adobe-systems/>, and the games division of Lucas Arts—the game is aimed, says John Kreidler, the group\'s executive director, at getting some 1,000 area leaders "engaged in the idea that culture is important." In some places this sort of persuasion might seem unnecessary—perhaps even self-indulgent. But Kreidler says it\'s needed here. "We could have created a PowerPoint show. But interactive media is the vernacular of Silicon Valley. A lot of the people we\'re trying to reach play games—computer games. It\'s part of their culture." Kreidler goes on to make the sort of good-for-bidness culture pitch that was familiar to residents of Texas in the oil-boom days—evidence that arts are a hard sell here. Just ask Sally Osberg.

I am seated at a large U-shaped conference table at the McKinsey <https://fortune.com/company/mckinsey/> & Co. offices in Palo Alto, along with two dozen members of a civic group called Cultural Initiatives Silicon Valley. Sleek black laptops, loaded and fired up, sit in front of us. We are here to be introduced to the group\'s new plan for convincing area leaders that culture is important. It is..a CD-ROM game. The game—catchily titled "is.C3: Creating a Great Region Through Commerce, Culture & Community"—is a simulation. It goes like this: Bruce Largecap, a major Silicon Valley tycoon, has been run over by a Mercedes SUV at the tender age of 44, leaving behind a $500 million endowment to support the arts.

The novel field of neuroaesthetics suggests that anything from listening to an opera to watching ballet to observing a painting can improve attention and ultimately lengthen one’s lifespan. “Those forms of beauty have a really beneficial impact on us,” Swart says. \n\nA fresh spin on aging\n\nResearch from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that people who have a positive view of aging tend to live longer and have better physical and cognitive health. \n\nMaddy Dychtwald, author of Ageless Aging, says there are a host of positives that come with climbing the chronological ladder, such as wisdom and self-acceptance. “We have agency that we never thought we had before,” she says. \n\nLesley Steinman, a research scientist in the health promotion research center at the University of Washington, cautions against using outdated terms, like “silver tsunami,” that perpetuate negative stereotypes about aging.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/2024/05/31/aging-sharp-mind-strategies/\n\nSource 4:\n“I think they develop an interest for Nordic art,” Tangen told Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/from-atlanta-to-dc-infill-subway-stations-are-closing-transit-gaps>, referring to international visitors. “I hope it will increase the competition in the museum world in Norway.

In picking his art, Tangen follows the advice he gives the fund’s traders—think contrarian. Instead of buying newer art that enters the market, he buys works over 50 years old to see their store of value over time.\n\nKunstsilo, once home to 15,000 tons of grain, is now the gallery with the world\'s comprehensive collection of Nordic modern art.\n\n“It was always meant to be a museum-like collection, which means that you want to have the most important artists and you want to have the most important work,” Tangen said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/09/norwegian-wealth-fund-ceo-nicolai-tangen-grain-silo-art-display-tourism-kristiansand/\n\nSource 5:\nManagers need clear expectations when it comes to culture.

As Katherine Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, notes, "creating and consuming art is tied to wellness. It makes us happy. It makes it possible for us to express emotion" [1]. Art has the ability to evoke emotions, spark imagination, and foster a sense of community. It can also serve as a reflection of the times we live in, providing a window into the past, present, and future.

Moreover, art has the power to shape our perceptions and understanding of the world around us. As Noah Horowitz, CEO of Art Basel, puts it, "we exist to power the careers of artists, but also create inspiring moments of connectivity and ultimately transform cities … developing local ecosystems that can fundamentally shift people's views of the society in which they live" [1]. Art can challenge our assumptions, spark critical thinking, and inspire social change. It can also provide a platform for underrepresented voices to be heard, promoting diversity

It can also provide a platform for underrepresented voices to be heard, promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.

2024-11-08 12:25:41,250: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Art has a profound impact on culture because it has the power to inspire, educate, and bring people together. As Katherine Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, notes, "creating and consuming art is tied to wellness. It makes us happy. It makes it possible for us to express emotion" [1]. Art has the ability to evoke emotions, spark imagination, and foster a sense of community. It can also serve as a reflection of the times we live in, providing a window into the past, present, and future.

Moreover, art has the power to shape our perceptions and understanding of the world around us. As Noah Horowitz, CEO of Art Basel, puts it, "we exist to power the careers of artists, but also create inspiring moments of connectivity and ultimately transform cities … developing local ecosystems that can fundamentally shift people's views of the society in which they live" [1]. Art can challenge our assumptions, spark critical thinking, and inspire social change. It can also provide a platform for underrepresented voices to be heard, promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Furthermore, art has a significant economic impact on culture. The global art market is estimated to be worth billions of dollars, with sales of art and antiques generating significant revenue for local economies [6]. Art festivals, exhibitions, and museums

2024-11-08 12:25:41,379: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Art has a profound impact on culture because it has the power to inspire, educate, and bring people together. As Katherine Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, notes, "creating and consuming art is tied to wellness. It makes us happy. It makes it possible for us to express emotion" [1]. Art has the ability to evoke emotions, spark imagination, and foster a sense of community. It can also serve as a reflection of the times we live in, providing a window into the past, present, and future.

Moreover, art has the power to shape our perceptions and understanding of the world around us. As Noah Horowitz, CEO of Art Basel, puts it, "we exist to power the careers of artists, but also create inspiring moments of connectivity and ultimately transform cities … developing local ecosystems that can fundamentally shift people's views of the society in which they live" [1]. Art can challenge our assumptions, spark critical thinking, and inspire social change. It can also provide a platform for underrepresented voices to be heard, promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Furthermore, art has a significant economic impact on culture. The global art market is estimated to be worth billions of dollars, with sales of art and antiques generating significant revenue for local economies [6]. Art festivals, exhibitions, and museums also attract tourists, creating jobs and stimulating local economies. As Nicolai Tangen

As Katherine Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, notes, "creating and consuming art is tied to wellness. It makes us happy. It makes it possible for us to express emotion" [1]. Art has the ability to evoke emotions, spark imagination, and foster a sense of community. It can also serve as a reflection of the times we live in, providing a window into the past, present, and future.

Moreover, art has the power to shape our perceptions and understanding of the world around us. As Noah Horowitz, CEO of Art Basel, puts it, "we exist to power the careers of artists, but also create inspiring moments of connectivity and ultimately transform cities … developing local ecosystems that can fundamentally shift people's views of the society in which they live" [1]. Art can challenge our assumptions, spark critical thinking, and inspire social change. It can also provide a platform for underrepresented voices to be heard, promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Furthermore, art has a significant economic impact on culture. The global art market is estimated to be worth billions of dollars, with sales of art and antiques generating significant revenue for local economies [6]. Art festivals, exhibitions, and museums also attract tourists, creating jobs and stimulating local economies. As Nicolai Tangen, CEO of the Norwegian Wealth Fund, notes, "I think they develop an interest for Nordic art

2024-11-08 12:25:41,651: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Art has a profound impact on culture because it has the power to inspire, educate, and bring people together. As Katherine Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, notes, "creating and consuming art is tied to wellness. It makes us happy. It makes it possible for us to express emotion" [1]. Art has the ability to evoke emotions, spark imagination, and foster a sense of community. It can also serve as a reflection of the times we live in, providing a window into the past, present, and future.

Moreover, art has the power to shape our perceptions and understanding of the world around us. As Noah Horowitz, CEO of Art Basel, puts it, "we exist to power the careers of artists, but also create inspiring moments of connectivity and ultimately transform cities … developing local ecosystems that can fundamentally shift people's views of the society in which they live" [1]. Art can challenge our assumptions, spark critical thinking, and inspire social change. It can also provide a platform for underrepresented voices to be heard, promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Furthermore, art has a significant economic impact on culture. The global art market is estimated to be worth billions of dollars, with sales of art and antiques generating significant revenue for local economies [6]. Art festivals, exhibitions, and museums also attract tourists, creating jobs and stimulating local economies. As Nicolai Tangen, CEO of the Norwegian Wealth Fund, notes, "I think they develop an interest for Nordic art," referring to international visitors [4]. Art has the power to bring people

2024-11-08 12:25:41,721: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Art has a profound impact on culture because it has the power to inspire, educate, and bring people together. As Katherine Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, notes, "creating and consuming art is tied to wellness. It makes us happy. It makes it possible for us to express emotion" [1]. Art has the ability to evoke emotions, spark imagination, and foster a sense of community. It can also serve as a reflection of the times we live in, providing a window into the past, present, and future.

Moreover, art has the power to shape our perceptions and understanding of the world around us. As Noah Horowitz, CEO of Art Basel, puts it, "we exist to power the careers of artists, but also create inspiring moments of connectivity and ultimately transform cities … developing local ecosystems that can fundamentally shift people's views of the society in which they live" [1]. Art can challenge our assumptions, spark critical thinking, and inspire social change. It can also provide a platform for underrepresented voices to be heard, promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Furthermore, art has a significant economic impact on culture. The global art market is estimated to be worth billions of dollars, with sales of art and antiques generating significant revenue for local economies [6]. Art festivals, exhibitions, and museums also attract tourists, creating jobs and stimulating local economies. As Nicolai Tangen, CEO of the Norwegian Wealth Fund, notes, "I think they develop an interest for Nordic art," referring to international visitors [4]. Art has the power to bring people together, foster cultural exchange, and promote economic growth.
