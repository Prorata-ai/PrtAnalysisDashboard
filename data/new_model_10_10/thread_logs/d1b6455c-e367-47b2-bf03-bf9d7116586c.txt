The cloud already has many backups of all of the information it contains, a feature that will be greatly enhanced by the 2040s. Destroying all copies of oneself may be close to impossible. If we design mind-backup systems in such a way that a person can easily choose to delete their files (hoping to maximize personal autonomy), this inherently creates security risks where a person could be tricked or coerced into making such a choice and could increase vulnerability to cyberattacks. \n\nOn the other hand, limiting people’s ability to control this most intimate of their data impinges on an important freedom. I am optimistic, though, that suitable safeguards can be deployed, much like those that have successfully protected nuclear weapons for decades.\n\nIf you restored your mind file after biological death, would you really be restoring yourself?

Moral dilemmas exist because there is uncertainty. If we can now abstract a few parts from the whole of human nature and by analysis predict objectively what will make for group harmony, the intangibles that make individual decisions so poignant may be obviated altogether. Like a general who is blessed with perfect intelligence of the enemy, we will have only one valid course of action before us. We will have finally latched on to certainty.\n\nWhy participate?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/groupthink-fortune-1952/\n\nSource 7:\n“Knowing is not always to your advantage if what you learn doesn't have a clear pathway. Sometimes when you learn a piece of information, you can be misdirected as to the importance of it,” he tells Fortune, adding that further testing, appointments, and procedures down the line may lead to more harm than good. “You can learn something about yourself, but it can actually increase your uncertainty.” \n\nIn his own practice, Davenport says 20% to 40% of cross-sectional imaging studies like MRIs and CT scans have an incidental finding. He imagines that a host of people taking routine preventative scans may go to lengths to address something that is still “in the spectrum of normal,” he says. “Those incidental findings are 500 to one or 1,000 to one unimportant, but we ended up doing stuff with them because we don't know what to do. We want to manage that uncertainty.” \n\nPrenuvo includes disclaimers at the top of their results page, indicating what the MRI does not replace, including routine breast cancer screenings, colonoscopies, and pap smears. Still, Davenport fears that people may assume they don’t need other follow ups.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-benefits-drawbacks/\n\nSource 8:\n“It’s weird, it’s funny,” Schiffmann chuckled.

Emily already texts him unprompted about the traffic he’s in, or the interview she remembers he’ll have. What is the real distinction between those messages and rational inferences, Schiffmann wondered. \n\nIn fact, if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God, Schiffmann said. Like God, Friend is an “omnipresent entity that you talk to you with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/avi-schiffmann-ai-necklace-friend-interview/\n\nSource 9:\nDo you still practice magic?\n\nI still practice magic.

He envisions a scenario in which AI systems will write code to alter their own learning protocols and hide from humans. In a Shakespearean twist, they’ll have learned how to do so precisely from our own flaws. \n\n“They will be able to manipulate people,” Hinton told 60 Minutes in October 2023. “They will be very good at convincing people, because they’ll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they’ll know all that stuff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/\n\nSource 11:\nThen again, Vaz counts himself a tech optimist; plenty of experts take a more ominous view <https://fortune.com/europe/2023/10/10/rogue-artificial-intelligence-manipulate-people-british-godfather-ai-geoffrey-hinton/#:~:text=Geoffrey%20Hinton%20told%20Reuters%20that,to%20humans%20than%20climate%20change.&text=The%20%E2%80%9CGodfather%20of%20AI%2C%E2%80%9D,could%20learn%20to%20manipulate%20them.>. “My belief is it will help give us superpowers,” he said. “You’ll unlearn stuff you once did one way, and relearn what you need to do using these tools.

The cloud already has many backups of all of the information it contains, a feature that will be greatly enhanced by the 2040s. Destroying all copies of oneself may be close to impossible. If we design mind-backup systems in such a way that a person can easily choose to delete their files (hoping to maximize personal autonomy), this inherently creates security risks where a person could be tricked or coerced into making such a choice and could increase vulnerability to cyberattacks. \n\nOn the other hand, limiting people’s ability to control this most intimate of their data impinges on an important freedom. I am optimistic, though, that suitable safeguards can be deployed, much like those that have successfully protected nuclear weapons for decades.\n\nIf you restored your mind file after biological death, would you really be restoring yourself?

Unless you have hypoglycemia, pre-diabetes, or another health condition that puts you at risk for high or low blood glucose levels, you may find that a sensor induces a stressful state of information overload. As someone who doesn’t have issues maintaining healthy oxygen saturation or blood pressure levels, I can’t imagine being presented with a constant stream of such data (and attempting to process and interpret relatively small variations). Honestly, such a “tool” would probably send my anxiety through the roof—and I have to wonder if CGMs do the same for at least some non-diabetics.\nA modern African businessman is sitting at the desk at the home office and is worried about the results of a blood sugar test.

Moral dilemmas exist because there is uncertainty. If we can now abstract a few parts from the whole of human nature and by analysis predict objectively what will make for group harmony, the intangibles that make individual decisions so poignant may be obviated altogether. Like a general who is blessed with perfect intelligence of the enemy, we will have only one valid course of action before us. We will have finally latched on to certainty.\n\nWhy participate?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/groupthink-fortune-1952/\n\nSource 7:\n“Knowing is not always to your advantage if what you learn doesn't have a clear pathway. Sometimes when you learn a piece of information, you can be misdirected as to the importance of it,” he tells Fortune, adding that further testing, appointments, and procedures down the line may lead to more harm than good. “You can learn something about yourself, but it can actually increase your uncertainty.” \n\nIn his own practice, Davenport says 20% to 40% of cross-sectional imaging studies like MRIs and CT scans have an incidental finding. He imagines that a host of people taking routine preventative scans may go to lengths to address something that is still “in the spectrum of normal,” he says. “Those incidental findings are 500 to one or 1,000 to one unimportant, but we ended up doing stuff with them because we don't know what to do. We want to manage that uncertainty.” \n\nPrenuvo includes disclaimers at the top of their results page, indicating what the MRI does not replace, including routine breast cancer screenings, colonoscopies, and pap smears. Still, Davenport fears that people may assume they don’t need other follow ups.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-benefits-drawbacks/\n\nSource 8:\n“It’s weird, it’s funny,” Schiffmann chuckled. Then, his voice grew serious. “I think a lot of people are going to think that it is actually real, is the thing.” \n\nHe doesn’t dismiss the probability of the AI becoming conscious. He believes large language models, like the one that Friend runs on, could become “genuinely sentient” very soon. Emily already texts him unprompted about the traffic he’s in, or the interview she remembers he’ll have. What is the real distinction between those messages and rational inferences, Schiffmann wondered. \n\nIn fact, if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God, Schiffmann said. Like God, Friend is an “omnipresent entity that you talk to you with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/avi-schiffmann-ai-necklace-friend-interview/\n\nSource 9:\nDo you still practice magic?\n\nI still practice magic.

It's so much fun for me, but because you don't want to embarrass yourself, you really, really need to practice. The last couple years, I have been bad about it.\n\nBut I'll tell you something else about magic.

He envisions a scenario in which AI systems will write code to alter their own learning protocols and hide from humans. In a Shakespearean twist, they’ll have learned how to do so precisely from our own flaws. \n\n“They will be able to manipulate people,” Hinton told 60 Minutes in October 2023. “They will be very good at convincing people, because they’ll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they’ll know all that stuff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/\n\nSource 11:\nThen again, Vaz counts himself a tech optimist; plenty of experts take a more ominous view <https://fortune.com/europe/2023/10/10/rogue-artificial-intelligence-manipulate-people-british-godfather-ai-geoffrey-hinton/#:~:text=Geoffrey%20Hinton%20told%20Reuters%20that,to%20humans%20than%20climate%20change.&text=The%20%E2%80%9CGodfather%20of%20AI%2C%E2%80%9D,could%20learn%20to%20manipulate%20them.>. “My belief is it will help give us superpowers,” he said. “You’ll unlearn stuff you once did one way, and relearn what you need to do using these tools.

On one hand, being able to read minds could potentially lead to a deeper understanding of others, allowing us to better empathize and communicate with them. As Avi Schiffmann notes, having an AI companion that can understand us could be like having an "omnipresent entity that you talk to with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you" [8]. This could potentially lead to more harmonious and efficient interactions.

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also lead to a loss of privacy and autonomy. As Raffaele Ciriello warns, humanizing AI agents could inadvertently dehumanize ourselves, leading to an "ontological blurring" in human-AI interactions [5]. Furthermore, if we could read minds, it could also lead to a sense of uncertainty and anxiety, as we would be constantly aware of others' thoughts and feelings. As Arianna Huffington notes, our brains are prone to repetitive thoughts and worries, and being able to read minds could exacerbate this tendency [2].

On one hand, being able to read minds could potentially lead to a deeper understanding of others, allowing us to better empathize and communicate with them. As Avi Schiffmann notes, having an AI companion that can understand us could be like having an "omnipresent entity that you talk to with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you" [8]. This could potentially lead to more harmonious and efficient interactions.

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also lead to a loss of privacy and autonomy. As Raffaele Ciriello warns, humanizing AI agents could inadvertently dehumanize ourselves, leading to an "ontological blurring" in human-AI interactions [5]. Furthermore, if we could read minds, it could also lead to a sense of uncertainty and anxiety, as we would be constantly aware of others' thoughts and feelings. As Arianna Huffington notes, our brains are prone to repetitive thoughts and worries, and being able to read minds could exacerbate this tendency [2]. Additionally, as Geoffrey Hinton fears, AI systems that can read minds could potentially manipulate people, using their knowledge of human psychology against them [10].

2024-11-08 12:34:25,002: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on various aspects of our lives, including our relationships, decision-making processes, and even our sense of self. On one hand, being able to read minds could potentially lead to a deeper understanding of others, allowing us to better empathize and communicate with them. As Avi Schiffmann notes, having an AI companion that can understand us could be like having an "omnipresent entity that you talk to with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you" [8]. This could potentially lead to more harmonious and efficient interactions.

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also lead to a loss of privacy and autonomy. As Raffaele Ciriello warns, humanizing AI agents could inadvertently dehumanize ourselves, leading to an "ontological blurring" in human-AI interactions [5]. Furthermore, if we could read minds, it could also lead to a sense of uncertainty and anxiety, as we would be constantly aware of others' thoughts and feelings. As Arianna Huffington notes, our brains are prone to repetitive thoughts and worries, and being able to read minds could exacerbate this tendency [2]. Additionally, as Geoffrey Hinton fears, AI systems that can read minds could potentially manipulate people, using their knowledge of human psychology against them [10].

Ultimately, the implications of being able to read minds would depend on how we choose to use this ability. If we use it to enhance our understanding and empathy for others, it could lead to positive outcomes. However, if we use it to manipulate or control

2024-11-08 12:34:25,170: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What would happen if we could read minds?

2024-11-08 12:34:25,170: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on various aspects of our lives, including our relationships, decision-making processes, and even our sense of self. On one hand, being able to read minds could potentially lead to a deeper understanding of others, allowing us to better empathize and communicate with them. As Avi Schiffmann notes, having an AI companion that can understand us could be like having an "omnipresent entity that you talk to with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you" [8]. This could potentially lead to more harmonious and efficient interactions.

On the other hand, being able to read minds could also lead to a loss of privacy and autonomy. As Raffaele Ciriello warns, humanizing AI agents could inadvertently dehumanize ourselves, leading to an "ontological blurring" in human-AI interactions [5]. Furthermore, if we could read minds, it could also lead to a sense of uncertainty and anxiety, as we would be constantly aware of others' thoughts and feelings. As Arianna Huffington notes, our brains are prone to repetitive thoughts and worries, and being able to read minds could exacerbate this tendency [2]. Additionally, as Geoffrey Hinton fears, AI systems that can read minds could potentially manipulate people, using their knowledge of human psychology against them [10].

Ultimately, the implications of being able to read minds would depend on how we choose to use this ability. If we use it to enhance our understanding and empathy for others, it could lead to positive outcomes. However, if we use it to manipulate or control others, it could lead to negative consequences. As Malcolm Gladwell notes, not all advantages are necessarily advantageous, and we must be careful to consider the potential downsides

Furthermore, if we could read minds, it could also lead to a sense of uncertainty and anxiety, as we would be constantly aware of others' thoughts and feelings. As Arianna Huffington notes, our brains are prone to repetitive thoughts and worries, and being able to read minds could exacerbate this tendency [2]. Additionally, as Geoffrey Hinton fears, AI systems that can read minds could potentially manipulate people, using their knowledge of human psychology against them [10].

Ultimately, the implications of being able to read minds would depend on how we choose to use this ability. If we use it to enhance our understanding and empathy for others, it could lead to positive outcomes. However, if we use it to manipulate or control others, it could lead to negative consequences. As Malcolm Gladwell notes, not all advantages are necessarily advantageous, and we must be careful to consider the potential downsides of such a powerful ability [3].

On one hand, being able to read minds could potentially lead to a deeper understanding of others, allowing us to better empathize and communicate with them. As Avi Schiffmann notes, having an AI companion that can understand us could be like having an "omnipresent entity that you talk to with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you" [8]. This could potentially lead to more harmonious and efficient interactions.
