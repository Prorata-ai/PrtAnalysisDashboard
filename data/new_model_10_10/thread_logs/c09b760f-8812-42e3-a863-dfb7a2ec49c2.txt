(Photo by Kena Betancur/Getty Images) \nContrasting approaches to AI models\n\nOne of the biggest differences between Zoom’s approach to AI and that of Microsoft and Google is access to the most sophisticated frontier models. Both of the hyperscalers have their own powerful AI models to turn to—Google’s Gemini and Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI—as well as their own cloud and data center infrastructure.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 3:\nBattling deepfakes <https://fortune.com/2022/09/03/live-deepfakes-detect-methods-zoom-fraud> is also a challenge for Zoom—one that has made media headlines, like when a deepfake caller posing as a Ukrainian official <https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/senator-cardin-deepfake.html> showed up on a Zoom call with Sen. Benjamin Cardin, chairman of the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee. But Yuan said the company is working on a feature to detect deepfakes: “We have high confidence that the problem will be fixed. Hopefully very soon you will see some announcements,” he said. “Authentication is key.” \n\nJobs are not at risk with an AI-driven workplace, CEO says\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 3:\n“We are way more than just meeting conferencing,” Yuan told Fortune in an exclusive interview in advance of the company’s Zoomtopia conference, which today unveiled a slew of new AI work and business features. These include upgrades to its Copilot-like “AI Companion” that allow users, at no extra cost, to generate content and search across Zoom’s workplace platform and connect data from third-party apps including Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/> Office and Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> Docs, as well as ServiceNow <https://fortune.com/company/servicenow/>, Glean, Workday, Box <https://fortune.com/company/box/>, Asana, and HubSpot <https://fortune.com/company/hubspot/>. \n\nThough he agreed the landscape of AI workplace tools is crowded, he insisted that Zoom’s AI moves and primary focus on the workplace position the company to challenge Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace for AI dominance at the office. \n\n“There’s too many [other] things on their plates,” Yuan said of his competitors, touting Zoom’s speed of innovation and culture of customer care. \n\nSome analysts are doubtful\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 3:\nYuan says Zoom’s approach is different in that it uses a variety of models, including its own LLM <https://fortune.com/2024/10/03/openai-google-microsoft-amazon-llms-characterai/> and those from OpenAI, Anthropic (Zoom is an investor), and Meta. “Essentially, we have four models together to compete [with] any of the single models,” he said, adding that this “federated” AI approach allows the company to choose the best model for each feature. For example, Zoom’s AI-generated meeting summaries are “much more accurate than any of our competitors,” he said. \n\nBut Newman of the Futurum Group said using multiple models will quickly become “table stakes.” After all, Microsoft, Google, Amazon <https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/>, and others all have the ability to use open-source models, like Meta’s Llama or those from Mistral, or licensed closed models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. “That’s a design choice,” he said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 3:\n“Imagine Company A and Company B are working together to negotiate a contract and they send their lawyers’ digital twins to come up with a preliminary draft [in] 20 to 30 minutes,” he said. “And afterward the two CEOs look at the draft without any problem. That’s the future of work.” \n\nZoom may offer the better experience, said the Futurum Group’s Newman, but that experience coexists with powerful alternatives. “Microsoft is not going to just lay down,” he explained. “Big companies have too many moats with how they can apply AI across the portfolio, and I think it’s going to actually create a tougher, more challenging climate.” \n\nThat doesn’t mean Zoom is out of luck, he added. “It just means I think they’re going to have to fight harder to win deals, despite whether they have some advantages with individual features.” \n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 4:\nMeanwhile, it similarly acquired Workvivo last year for around €250 million <https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/workvivos-revenue-and-losses-doubled-prior-to-zoom-takeover/a81188355.html#:~:text=The%20Cork%20tech%20firm%20Workvivo,loss%20of%20the%20year%20before.> ($272 million). \n\nThe employee engagement tool, which acts like Slack but has an interface similar to Facebook <https://fortune.com/company/facebook/>, is now being used by the likes of Amazon <https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/>, Bupa <https://fortune.com/company/bupa/>, and Ryanair—and, as Geddes points out, “has nothing to do with video.”\n\n“We\'re helping our customers in the way that their customers show up to their website, having a chatbot automation service that can escalate into a phone call,” Geddes added. “A lot of workflows that have no video involved.”\n\nZoom needs a second act if it wants to remain relevant\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/\n\nSource 4:\nWhen the COVID pandemic forced the corporate world to operate online, Zoom <https://fortune.com/company/zoom/> was suddenly thrust into everyday vocabulary.

Both of the hyperscalers have their own powerful AI models to turn to—Google’s Gemini and Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI—as well as their own cloud and data center infrastructure.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 3:\nBattling deepfakes <https://fortune.com/2022/09/03/live-deepfakes-detect-methods-zoom-fraud> is also a challenge for Zoom—one that has made media headlines, like when a deepfake caller posing as a Ukrainian official <https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/senator-cardin-deepfake.html> showed up on a Zoom call with Sen. Benjamin Cardin, chairman of the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee. But Yuan said the company is working on a feature to detect deepfakes: “We have high confidence that the problem will be fixed.

These include upgrades to its Copilot-like “AI Companion” that allow users, at no extra cost, to generate content and search across Zoom’s workplace platform and connect data from third-party apps including Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/> Office and Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> Docs, as well as ServiceNow <https://fortune.com/company/servicenow/>, Glean, Workday, Box <https://fortune.com/company/box/>, Asana, and HubSpot <https://fortune.com/company/hubspot/>. \n\nThough he agreed the landscape of AI workplace tools is crowded, he insisted that Zoom’s AI moves and primary focus on the workplace position the company to challenge Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace for AI dominance at the office. \n\n“There’s too many [other] things on their plates,” Yuan said of his competitors, touting Zoom’s speed of innovation and culture of customer care. \n\nSome analysts are doubtful\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 3:\nYuan says Zoom’s approach is different in that it uses a variety of models, including its own LLM <https://fortune.com/2024/10/03/openai-google-microsoft-amazon-llms-characterai/> and those from OpenAI, Anthropic (Zoom is an investor), and Meta. “Essentially, we have four models together to compete [with] any of the single models,” he said, adding that this “federated” AI approach allows the company to choose the best model for each feature. For example, Zoom’s AI-generated meeting summaries are “much more accurate than any of our competitors,” he said. \n\nBut Newman of the Futurum Group said using multiple models will quickly become “table stakes.” After all, Microsoft, Google, Amazon <https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/>, and others all have the ability to use open-source models, like Meta’s Llama or those from Mistral, or licensed closed models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. “That’s a design choice,” he said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 3:\n“Imagine Company A and Company B are working together to negotiate a contract and they send their lawyers’ digital twins to come up with a preliminary draft [in] 20 to 30 minutes,” he said. “And afterward the two CEOs look at the draft without any problem. That’s the future of work.” \n\nZoom may offer the better experience, said the Futurum Group’s Newman, but that experience coexists with powerful alternatives. “Microsoft is not going to just lay down,” he explained. “Big companies have too many moats with how they can apply AI across the portfolio, and I think it’s going to actually create a tougher, more challenging climate.” \n\nThat doesn’t mean Zoom is out of luck, he added. “It just means I think they’re going to have to fight harder to win deals, despite whether they have some advantages with individual features.” \n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 4:\nMeanwhile, it similarly acquired Workvivo last year for around €250 million <https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/workvivos-revenue-and-losses-doubled-prior-to-zoom-takeover/a81188355.html#:~:text=The%20Cork%20tech%20firm%20Workvivo,loss%20of%20the%20year%20before.> ($272 million). \n\nThe employee engagement tool, which acts like Slack but has an interface similar to Facebook <https://fortune.com/company/facebook/>, is now being used by the likes of Amazon <https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/>, Bupa <https://fortune.com/company/bupa/>, and Ryanair—and, as Geddes points out, “has nothing to do with video.”\n\n“We\'re helping our customers in the way that their customers show up to their website, having a chatbot automation service that can escalate into a phone call,” Geddes added. “A lot of workflows that have no video involved.”\n\nZoom needs a second act if it wants to remain relevant\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/\n\nSource 4:\nWhen the COVID pandemic forced the corporate world to operate online, Zoom <https://fortune.com/company/zoom/> was suddenly thrust into everyday vocabulary.

Has hell frozen over?\n\n“Connecting people has been really important as we\'ve expanded out beyond our core into other verticals,” Zoom’s chief people officer, Matthew Saxon, explained in a recent Fortune interview. “We are still majority-remote, but I think a lot of people forget our many products and solutions that are only designed for in-office work.” \n\nZoom has customers, “by the way, who span the gamut,” said Saxon, who joined the company from Meta in 2022. “We\'ve got customers who are completely in the office. We\'ve got customers who are completely remote, and we\'ve got all the various flavors of hybrid in between. We want to ensure we’re very customer-centric; that means really, truly understanding the customer use case and pain points.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/09/remote-work-outlook-zoom-return-to-office-chief-people-officer/\n\nSource 2:\nZoom didn\'t respond to Fortune\'s request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/zoom-founder-eric-yuan-digital-ai-twins-attend-meetings-for-you/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/zoom-founder-eric-yuan-digital-ai-twins-attend-meetings-for-you/\n\nSource 3:\nSome analysts are doubtful\n\nBut some analysts are doubtful Zoom can take on Microsoft’s and Google’s massive resources and long history in work solutions. Daniel Newman, CEO and chief analyst at the Futurum Group, told Fortune that while Zoom’s platform and AI features may win when it comes to its user-friendly experience and service, “these are also companies that can build their own models, they can deploy data center infrastructure at incredible scale, and they own the office environment—processing email, spreadsheets.” \n\nOthers are prepared to give Zoom the benefit of the doubt, as it has shown it can focus on collaboration and can form relationships with makers of other Microsoft and Google competitors, including Salesforce <https://fortune.com/company/salesforce-com/> and Slack, said Ross Rubin, founder and principal analyst at Reticle Research. “Every company is feeling compelled to roll AI into their [products]; the next challenge will be how they work together to get out of their silos,” he said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 3:\nDan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, added that Zoom has a big opportunity in AI work solutions because it is already installed and used on so many devices. “They’re in a very strong position to monetize,” he said. “Over the coming years, they have to prove it out—but this is a big enough ocean for more than two boats.” \nNEW YORK, NY - APRIL 18: Zoom founder Eric Yuan poses in front of the Nasdaq <https://fortune.com/company/nasdaq/> building as the screen shows the logo of the video-conferencing software company Zoom after the opening bell ceremony on April 18, 2019 in New York City. The video-conferencing software company announced it\'s IPO priced at $36 per share, at an estimated value of $9.2 billion. (Photo by Kena Betancur/Getty Images) \nContrasting approaches to AI models\n\nOne of the biggest differences between Zoom’s approach to AI and that of Microsoft and Google is access to the most sophisticated frontier models. Both of the hyperscalers have their own powerful AI models to turn to—Google’s Gemini and Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI—as well as their own cloud and data center infrastructure.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 3:\nBattling deepfakes <https://fortune.com/2022/09/03/live-deepfakes-detect-methods-zoom-fraud> is also a challenge for Zoom—one that has made media headlines, like when a deepfake caller posing as a Ukrainian official <https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/senator-cardin-deepfake.html> showed up on a Zoom call with Sen. Benjamin Cardin, chairman of the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee. But Yuan said the company is working on a feature to detect deepfakes: “We have high confidence that the problem will be fixed. Hopefully very soon you will see some announcements,” he said. “Authentication is key.” \n\nJobs are not at risk with an AI-driven workplace, CEO says\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 3:\n“We are way more than just meeting conferencing,” Yuan told Fortune in an exclusive interview in advance of the company’s Zoomtopia conference, which today unveiled a slew of new AI work and business features. These include upgrades to its Copilot-like “AI Companion” that allow users, at no extra cost, to generate content and search across Zoom’s workplace platform and connect data from third-party apps including Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/> Office and Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> Docs, as well as ServiceNow <https://fortune.com/company/servicenow/>, Glean, Workday, Box <https://fortune.com/company/box/>, Asana, and HubSpot <https://fortune.com/company/hubspot/>. \n\nThough he agreed the landscape of AI workplace tools is crowded, he insisted that Zoom’s AI moves and primary focus on the workplace position the company to challenge Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace for AI dominance at the office. \n\n“There’s too many [other] things on their plates,” Yuan said of his competitors, touting Zoom’s speed of innovation and culture of customer care. \n\nSome analysts are doubtful\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 3:\nYuan says Zoom’s approach is different in that it uses a variety of models, including its own LLM <https://fortune.com/2024/10/03/openai-google-microsoft-amazon-llms-characterai/> and those from OpenAI, Anthropic (Zoom is an investor), and Meta. “Essentially, we have four models together to compete [with] any of the single models,” he said, adding that this “federated” AI approach allows the company to choose the best model for each feature. For example, Zoom’s AI-generated meeting summaries are “much more accurate than any of our competitors,” he said. \n\nBut Newman of the Futurum Group said using multiple models will quickly become “table stakes.” After all, Microsoft, Google, Amazon <https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/>, and others all have the ability to use open-source models, like Meta’s Llama or those from Mistral, or licensed closed models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. “That’s a design choice,” he said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 3:\n“Imagine Company A and Company B are working together to negotiate a contract and they send their lawyers’ digital twins to come up with a preliminary draft [in] 20 to 30 minutes,” he said. “And afterward the two CEOs look at the draft without any problem. That’s the future of work.” \n\nZoom may offer the better experience, said the Futurum Group’s Newman, but that experience coexists with powerful alternatives. “Microsoft is not going to just lay down,” he explained. “Big companies have too many moats with how they can apply AI across the portfolio, and I think it’s going to actually create a tougher, more challenging climate.” \n\nThat doesn’t mean Zoom is out of luck, he added. “It just means I think they’re going to have to fight harder to win deals, despite whether they have some advantages with individual features.” \n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-interview-says-ai-workplace-future-challenge-microsoft-google/\n\nSource 4:\nMeanwhile, it similarly acquired Workvivo last year for around €250 million <https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/workvivos-revenue-and-losses-doubled-prior-to-zoom-takeover/a81188355.html#:~:text=The%20Cork%20tech%20firm%20Workvivo,loss%20of%20the%20year%20before.> ($272 million). \n\nThe employee engagement tool, which acts like Slack but has an interface similar to Facebook <https://fortune.com/company/facebook/>, is now being used by the likes of Amazon <https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/>, Bupa <https://fortune.com/company/bupa/>, and Ryanair—and, as Geddes points out, “has nothing to do with video.”\n\n“We\'re helping our customers in the way that their customers show up to their website, having a chatbot automation service that can escalate into a phone call,” Geddes added. “A lot of workflows that have no video involved.”\n\nZoom needs a second act if it wants to remain relevant\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/\n\nSource 4:\nWhen the COVID pandemic forced the corporate world to operate online, Zoom <https://fortune.com/company/zoom/> was suddenly thrust into everyday vocabulary. "Can we have a quick catch-up in the kitchen?" was suddenly replaced with a simple "Zoom?"\n\nBut now, the $19 billion video-calling giant no longer wants to be known for the very thing that made it famous. \n\nZoom is “so much more than just video meetings,” Graeme Geddes, Zoom’s chief growth officer, told Fortune. “Video is our heritage—so we\'re going to continue to lean in there, push the market, there\'s a lot of innovation that we\'re doing—but we\'re so much more than that.”\n\nSo what does the company primarily known for enabling remote workers to connect through a screen want to be known as going forward? \n\n“We want to be known as an AI-first collaboration platform,” Geddes responded.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/\n\nSource 4:\nEarlier this month, Zoom\'s founder and CEO Eric Yuan revealed that the company is developing deepfake avatars—or as he puts it, “digital twins” <https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/zoom-founder-eric-yuan-digital-ai-twins-attend-meetings-for-you/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks>—that’ll look like you, talk like you, and make business decisions on your behalf during meetings.\n\n“Today we all spend a lot of time either making phone calls, joining meetings, sending emails, deleting some spam emails, and replying to some text messages, still very busy,” Yuan said. \n\nBut in the future, he added: "I can send a digital version of myself to join so I can go to the beach.”\n\nWhile Zoom’s digital twin technology is still quite some way away from becoming a reality, Geddes said that he’s already using the company’s current AI capabilities to manage being missing in action without leaving his team adrift.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/\n\nSource 5:\nZoom <https://fortune.com/company/zoom/> out.
