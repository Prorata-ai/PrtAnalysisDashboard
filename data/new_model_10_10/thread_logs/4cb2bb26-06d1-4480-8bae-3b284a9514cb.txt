In private conversations, financiers from some of the biggest banks in Europe and the US (as well as a major Canadian lender) told Bloomberg Green they’re at a loss about what to do with biodiversity.\n\nIt’s not that they’re ignorant of the threat to human life and economic output posed by mass extinctions or breakdowns of natural systems. It’s just that they don’t understand how to measure its impact on their operations—or how to make money from it.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/17/bankers-biodiversity-climate-change-measure/\n\nSource 1:\nA year later, world leaders agreed to protect and restore <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-19/cop15-adopts-biodiversity-plan-to-protect-30-of-land-and-water-by-2030> 30% of the Earth’s land and oceans by 2030. The goal rallied investors around a new catchphrase called “nature positive,” which refers to the idea of stopping and eventually reversing biodiversity loss. It’s the new “net zero,” only for biodiversity. \n\nTwo years on, it’s become apparent to the bankers Bloomberg Green spoke to that nature is vastly more complex than climate. While climate impacts can be boiled down to a single metric that can be measured, priced and traded — greenhouse gas emissions — there’s no simple or comparable way to measure changes in biodiversity across different geographies and ecosystems.\n\nIn other words, it’s not clear <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-08/how-biodiversity-hopes-to-match-climate-s-investing-quicktake> how the market should value a swamp or a newly discovered frog species.

And even with the challenges of monetizing nature, banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Standard Chartered Plc are sending representatives in the hope that biodiversity can be a source of new deals.\n\nSustainable finance in brief\nSustainable finance in brief\n\nThe European Central Bank has stepped up its efforts to prepare lenders for the fallout from climate change by warning they face even more fines if they don’t sufficiently address the risks ahead. A “small group of outliers” faces periodic penalty payments after the ECB found that they’re still missing “foundational elements for the adequate management of climate and nature-related risks,” said Frank Elderson, a member of ECB’s Executive Board. The ECB has steadily ramped up pressure on banks to ensure they can contend with losses resulting from extreme weather or carbon-intensive companies having difficulty paying back loans. While many banks say they’re working on the issue, the watchdog’s tough approach has been a key source of friction with the industry <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-04/ecb-warns-banks-of-yet-more-fines-over-climate-risk-management?sref=Ufko9ynM>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/17/bankers-biodiversity-climate-change-measure/\n\nSource 1:\nNo one knows what to do, said a senior banker at a major US lender, who asked not to be identified for expressing opinions that may differ from those of their employer. As such, the bank’s work on nature has stalled, the banker said.\n\nWhile quantifying climate-related risks and aligning portfolios accordingly has been a multi-year effort for everyone from standard setters to finance executives, biodiversity was adopted into sustainability teams’ remit on a much more accelerated timeline <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-15/why-is-wall-street-so-hot-for-biodiversity-right-now>.\n\nThe launch <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-03/biodiversity-disclosures-set-to-become-part-of-company-reporting> of the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures in 2021, which asks companies to report their biodiversity footprint, was a key moment in elevating the nature agenda.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/17/bankers-biodiversity-climate-change-measure/\n\nSource 1:\n“Banks will have a big role to play in plugging the global biodiversity funding gap,” she said. “They will need to move with pace, looking for innovative ways to raise capital.”\n\nBoston Consulting Group estimates nature to be a more than $1.2 trillion opportunity, with the largest investments to be made in sectors including chemicals, power utilities, food and beverage and healthcare.\n\n“It’s just a matter of time for nature to become a commercial opportunity for bankers,” said Lucyann Murray, a partner at BCG. “Companies are starting to act. I wouldn’t turn a blind eye to nature.”\n\nNo matter what happens, financiers are unlikely to be able to evade the topic, as nature is becoming more prominent in corporate and government agendas, said John Bromley, managing director of clean energy strategy and investments at Legal & General Group Plc.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/17/bankers-biodiversity-climate-change-measure/\n\nSource 2:\nMake no mistake: If we lose the Congo Basin forests, the global fight against climate change will be set back by 15 to 20 years. We would also lose the water, the lifeblood of Africa that is pumped out of its green heart—and the consequences will be counted in hundreds of millions of climate refugees in the coming decades. \n\nPut simply, Africa is not viable without the Congo Basin forests—or at least that is the indication of the scant evidence that exists.\n\nIn my new role as the Special Envoy of the Science Panel for the Congo Basin (SPCB), it is my duty to sound the alarm. We must build more bridges between scientists, donors, and policy makers. The SPCB, along with our sister initiative, the Science Initiative for the Congo Basin, need your support and investment.

Nearly half of the global population already live in areas highly vulnerable to climate change. We need immediate action to help them become more resilient—or we face dire consequences. If action persists being delayed, the collapse of healthcare systems, widespread food and water shortages, and mass displacement will become our new reality.\n\nThere is simply not enough money being invested to help communities and local healthcare systems adapt to the health threats of climate change. Alarmingly, there is currently a staggering $366 billion finance gap <https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2023> when it comes to annual funding for climate adaptation, with less than 5% of climate adaptation finance being allocated to projects that protect or improve health.

In private conversations, financiers from some of the biggest banks in Europe and the US (as well as a major Canadian lender) told Bloomberg Green they’re at a loss about what to do with biodiversity.\n\nIt’s not that they’re ignorant of the threat to human life and economic output posed by mass extinctions or breakdowns of natural systems. It’s just that they don’t understand how to measure its impact on their operations—or how to make money from it.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/17/bankers-biodiversity-climate-change-measure/\n\nSource 1:\nA year later, world leaders agreed to protect and restore <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-19/cop15-adopts-biodiversity-plan-to-protect-30-of-land-and-water-by-2030> 30% of the Earth’s land and oceans by 2030. The goal rallied investors around a new catchphrase called “nature positive,” which refers to the idea of stopping and eventually reversing biodiversity loss. It’s the new “net zero,” only for biodiversity. \n\nTwo years on, it’s become apparent to the bankers Bloomberg Green spoke to that nature is vastly more complex than climate. While climate impacts can be boiled down to a single metric that can be measured, priced and traded — greenhouse gas emissions — there’s no simple or comparable way to measure changes in biodiversity across different geographies and ecosystems.\n\nIn other words, it’s not clear <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-08/how-biodiversity-hopes-to-match-climate-s-investing-quicktake> how the market should value a swamp or a newly discovered frog species.

A “small group of outliers” faces periodic penalty payments after the ECB found that they’re still missing “foundational elements for the adequate management of climate and nature-related risks,” said Frank Elderson, a member of ECB’s Executive Board. The ECB has steadily ramped up pressure on banks to ensure they can contend with losses resulting from extreme weather or carbon-intensive companies having difficulty paying back loans. While many banks say they’re working on the issue, the watchdog’s tough approach has been a key source of friction with the industry <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-04/ecb-warns-banks-of-yet-more-fines-over-climate-risk-management?sref=Ufko9ynM>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/17/bankers-biodiversity-climate-change-measure/\n\nSource 1:\nNo one knows what to do, said a senior banker at a major US lender, who asked not to be identified for expressing opinions that may differ from those of their employer. As such, the bank’s work on nature has stalled, the banker said.\n\nWhile quantifying climate-related risks and aligning portfolios accordingly has been a multi-year effort for everyone from standard setters to finance executives, biodiversity was adopted into sustainability teams’ remit on a much more accelerated timeline <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-15/why-is-wall-street-so-hot-for-biodiversity-right-now>.\n\nThe launch <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-03/biodiversity-disclosures-set-to-become-part-of-company-reporting> of the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures in 2021, which asks companies to report their biodiversity footprint, was a key moment in elevating the nature agenda.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/17/bankers-biodiversity-climate-change-measure/\n\nSource 1:\n“Banks will have a big role to play in plugging the global biodiversity funding gap,” she said. “They will need to move with pace, looking for innovative ways to raise capital.”\n\nBoston Consulting Group estimates nature to be a more than $1.2 trillion opportunity, with the largest investments to be made in sectors including chemicals, power utilities, food and beverage and healthcare.\n\n“It’s just a matter of time for nature to become a commercial opportunity for bankers,” said Lucyann Murray, a partner at BCG. “Companies are starting to act. I wouldn’t turn a blind eye to nature.”\n\nNo matter what happens, financiers are unlikely to be able to evade the topic, as nature is becoming more prominent in corporate and government agendas, said John Bromley, managing director of clean energy strategy and investments at Legal & General Group Plc.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/17/bankers-biodiversity-climate-change-measure/\n\nSource 2:\nMake no mistake: If we lose the Congo Basin forests, the global fight against climate change will be set back by 15 to 20 years.

As emphasized in [2], the Congo Basin forests, for instance, are essential for the global fight against climate change, and their loss would set back efforts by 15 to 20 years. Moreover, these forests support life for 80 million people and provide water for a further 300 million rural Africans in surrounding regions. This highlights the significance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological stability and supporting human well-being.

As emphasized in [2], the Congo Basin forests, for instance, are essential for the global fight against climate change, and their loss would set back efforts by 15 to 20 years. Moreover, these forests support life for 80 million people and provide water for a further 300 million rural Africans in surrounding regions. This highlights the significance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological stability and supporting human well-being.

The importance of biodiversity extends beyond forests to oceans, which provide services that scientists call "existentially important" [4]. Oceans produce more than half of the oxygen we breathe,

Moreover, these forests support life for 80 million people and provide water for a further 300 million rural Africans in surrounding regions. This highlights the significance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological stability and supporting human well-being.

The importance of biodiversity extends beyond forests to oceans, which provide services that scientists call "existentially important" [4]. Oceans produce more than half of the oxygen we breathe, serve as the world's largest carbon sink, and absorb 30% of our carbon emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by them.

2024-11-08 12:25:26,327: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Biodiversity is crucial for the planet's health because it plays a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems and supporting life on Earth. As emphasized in [2], the Congo Basin forests, for instance, are essential for the global fight against climate change, and their loss would set back efforts by 15 to 20 years. Moreover, these forests support life for 80 million people and provide water for a further 300 million rural Africans in surrounding regions. This highlights the significance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological stability and supporting human well-being.

The importance of biodiversity extends beyond forests to oceans, which provide services that scientists call "existentially important" [4]. Oceans produce more than half of the oxygen we breathe, serve as the world's largest carbon sink, and absorb 30% of our carbon emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by them. The loss of biodiversity in oceans would have catastrophic consequences for the planet's health.

As emphasized in [2], the Congo Basin forests, for instance, are essential for the global fight against climate change, and their loss would set back efforts by 15 to 20 years. Moreover, these forests support life for 80 million people and provide water for a further 300 million rural Africans in surrounding regions. This highlights the significance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological stability and supporting human well-being.

The importance of biodiversity extends beyond forests to oceans, which provide services that scientists call "existentially important" [4]. Oceans produce more than half of the oxygen we breathe, serve as the world's largest carbon sink, and absorb 30% of our carbon emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by them. The loss of biodiversity in oceans would have catastrophic consequences for the planet's health. Furthermore, biodiversity is essential for human health, as it provides the foundation for many medicines and supports the food chain. As noted in [5], microplastics have been found in unexpected places, including human hearts

As emphasized in [2], the Congo Basin forests, for instance, are essential for the global fight against climate change, and their loss would set back efforts by 15 to 20 years. Moreover, these forests support life for 80 million people and provide water for a further 300 million rural Africans in surrounding regions. This highlights the significance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological stability and supporting human well-being.

The importance of biodiversity extends beyond forests to oceans, which provide services that scientists call "existentially important" [4]. Oceans produce more than half of the oxygen we breathe, serve as the world's largest carbon sink, and absorb 30% of our carbon emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by them. The loss of biodiversity in oceans would have catastrophic consequences for the planet's health. Furthermore, biodiversity is essential for human health, as it provides the foundation for many medicines and supports the food chain. As noted in [5], microplastics have been found in unexpected places, including human hearts, blood, and lungs, highlighting the interconnectedness of human and environmental health.

2024-11-08 12:25:26,892: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Biodiversity is crucial for the planet's health because it plays a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems and supporting life on Earth. As emphasized in [2], the Congo Basin forests, for instance, are essential for the global fight against climate change, and their loss would set back efforts by 15 to 20 years. Moreover, these forests support life for 80 million people and provide water for a further 300 million rural Africans in surrounding regions. This highlights the significance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological stability and supporting human well-being.

The importance of biodiversity extends beyond forests to oceans, which provide services that scientists call "existentially important" [4]. Oceans produce more than half of the oxygen we breathe, serve as the world's largest carbon sink, and absorb 30% of our carbon emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by them. The loss of biodiversity in oceans would have catastrophic consequences for the planet's health. Furthermore, biodiversity is essential for human health, as it provides the foundation for many medicines and supports the food chain. As noted in [5], microplastics have been found in unexpected places, including human hearts, blood, and lungs, highlighting the interconnectedness of human and environmental health.

The preservation of biodiversity is also critical for economic stability. As stated in [1], the European Central Bank has stepped up its efforts to prepare lenders

2024-11-08 12:25:26,985: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Biodiversity is crucial for the planet's health because it plays a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems and supporting life on Earth. As emphasized in [2], the Congo Basin forests, for instance, are essential for the global fight against climate change, and their loss would set back efforts by 15 to 20 years. Moreover, these forests support life for 80 million people and provide water for a further 300 million rural Africans in surrounding regions. This highlights the significance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological stability and supporting human well-being.

The importance of biodiversity extends beyond forests to oceans, which provide services that scientists call "existentially important" [4]. Oceans produce more than half of the oxygen we breathe, serve as the world's largest carbon sink, and absorb 30% of our carbon emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by them. The loss of biodiversity in oceans would have catastrophic consequences for the planet's health. Furthermore, biodiversity is essential for human health, as it provides the foundation for many medicines and supports the food chain. As noted in [5], microplastics have been found in unexpected places, including human hearts, blood, and lungs, highlighting the interconnectedness of human and environmental health.

The preservation of biodiversity is also critical for economic stability. As stated in [1], the European Central Bank has stepped up its efforts to prepare lenders for the fallout from climate change and biodiversity loss, warning that they face fines

2024-11-08 12:25:27,142: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Biodiversity is crucial for the planet's health because it plays a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems and supporting life on Earth. As emphasized in [2], the Congo Basin forests, for instance, are essential for the global fight against climate change, and their loss would set back efforts by 15 to 20 years. Moreover, these forests support life for 80 million people and provide water for a further 300 million rural Africans in surrounding regions. This highlights the significance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological stability and supporting human well-being.

The importance of biodiversity extends beyond forests to oceans, which provide services that scientists call "existentially important" [4]. Oceans produce more than half of the oxygen we breathe, serve as the world's largest carbon sink, and absorb 30% of our carbon emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by them. The loss of biodiversity in oceans would have catastrophic consequences for the planet's health. Furthermore, biodiversity is essential for human health, as it provides the foundation for many medicines and supports the food chain. As noted in [5], microplastics have been found in unexpected places, including human hearts, blood, and lungs, highlighting the interconnectedness of human and environmental health.

The preservation of biodiversity is also critical for economic stability. As stated in [1], the European Central Bank has stepped up its efforts to prepare lenders for the fallout from climate change and biodiversity loss, warning that they face fines if they don't sufficiently address the risks ahead. Moreover, Boston Consulting Group estimates that nature is a more than

2024-11-08 12:25:27,241: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why is biodiversity crucial for the planet's health?

2024-11-08 12:25:27,241: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Biodiversity is crucial for the planet's health because it plays a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems and supporting life on Earth. As emphasized in [2], the Congo Basin forests, for instance, are essential for the global fight against climate change, and their loss would set back efforts by 15 to 20 years. Moreover, these forests support life for 80 million people and provide water for a further 300 million rural Africans in surrounding regions. This highlights the significance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological stability and supporting human well-being.

The importance of biodiversity extends beyond forests to oceans, which provide services that scientists call "existentially important" [4]. Oceans produce more than half of the oxygen we breathe, serve as the world's largest carbon sink, and absorb 30% of our carbon emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by them. The loss of biodiversity in oceans would have catastrophic consequences for the planet's health. Furthermore, biodiversity is essential for human health, as it provides the foundation for many medicines and supports the food chain. As noted in [5], microplastics have been found in unexpected places, including human hearts, blood, and lungs, highlighting the interconnectedness of human and environmental health.

The preservation of biodiversity is also critical for economic stability. As stated in [1], the European Central Bank has stepped up its efforts to prepare lenders for the fallout from climate change and biodiversity loss, warning that they face fines if they don't sufficiently address the risks ahead. Moreover, Boston Consulting Group estimates that nature is a more than $1.2 trillion opportunity, with the largest investments to be made in sectors including chemicals

2024-11-08 12:25:27,399: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Biodiversity is crucial for the planet's health because it plays a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems and supporting life on Earth. As emphasized in [2], the Congo Basin forests, for instance, are essential for the global fight against climate change, and their loss would set back efforts by 15 to 20 years. Moreover, these forests support life for 80 million people and provide water for a further 300 million rural Africans in surrounding regions. This highlights the significance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological stability and supporting human well-being.

The importance of biodiversity extends beyond forests to oceans, which provide services that scientists call "existentially important" [4]. Oceans produce more than half of the oxygen we breathe, serve as the world's largest carbon sink, and absorb 30% of our carbon emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by them. The loss of biodiversity in oceans would have catastrophic consequences for the planet's health. Furthermore, biodiversity is essential for human health, as it provides the foundation for many medicines and supports the food chain. As noted in [5], microplastics have been found in unexpected places, including human hearts, blood, and lungs, highlighting the interconnectedness of human and environmental health.

2024-11-08 12:25:27,418: ObserveEventsHandler(  207): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd response: assistant: Biodiversity is crucial for the planet's health because it plays a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems and supporting life on Earth. As emphasized in [2], the Congo Basin forests, for instance, are essential for the global fight against climate change, and their loss would set back efforts by 15 to 20 years. Moreover, these forests support life for 80 million people and provide water for a further 300 million rural Africans in surrounding regions. This highlights the significance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological stability and supporting human well-being.

The importance of biodiversity extends beyond forests to oceans, which provide services that scientists call "existentially important" [4]. Oceans produce more than half of the oxygen we breathe, serve as the world's largest carbon sink, and absorb 30% of our carbon emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by them. The loss of biodiversity in oceans would have catastrophic consequences for the planet's health. Furthermore, biodiversity is essential for human health, as it provides the foundation for many medicines and supports the food chain. As noted in [5], microplastics have been found in unexpected places, including human hearts, blood, and lungs, highlighting the interconnectedness of human and environmental health.

The preservation of biodiversity is also critical for economic stability. As stated in [1], the European Central Bank has stepped up its efforts to prepare lenders for the fallout from climate change and biodiversity loss, warning that they face fines if they don't sufficiently address the risks ahead. Moreover, Boston Consulting Group estimates that nature is a more than $1.2 trillion opportunity, with the largest investments to be made in sectors including chemicals, power utilities, food and beverage, and healthcare [1]. This underscores the significance of biodiversity in supporting economic growth and development.
