He did have the opportunity to name a friend’s chocolate labrador once—a rare occasion where he could run wild, free from the constraints of trademark availability and client feedback.\n\nShore named the labrador after a brand of chocolate syrup he remembers fondly from his childhood: Bosco.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/professional-namer-anthony-shore-accenture-rename-career/>', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.64648765), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='94594799-ed96-4f8d-a94e-a8bf5ef3be25', embedding=None, metadata={'id': '4a07ea7338c5f494e4cf49830d5b0ad2d386a4c5bb37498214a55c0a989589ad-2', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': '4a07ea7338c5f494e4cf49830d5b0ad2d386a4c5bb37498214a55c0a989589ad', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20240912, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-08', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1653145677-e1726162930128.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2024, 'date_month': 9, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/2024/09/12/onlyfans-reveals-record-breaking-revenue-6-6-billion-2023/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 12, 'title': 'OnlyFans reveals record-breaking revenue, raking in $6.6 billion last year', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/2024/09/12/onlyfans-reveals-record-breaking-revenue-6-6-billion-2023/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='o2c%2BTk%2Be8U9lGRaTTu9RDonUymZ5AqlVr0Y94dKC5GnI4dNhgfIGfGQoH5HdTJ52hDQrFpCTWgE%2F8MtCJQNo%2FRQsGoMwT6wgLeMZAYlQ1FSH%2F8p%2F%2BZhI6kVmacdijv4STSzSuwRDs%2FmNT%2BUDXABkdhSFRPIClKcaXYqaQZm3IIwCrY1QKqYEJ8Ez3pY5W4814AQLPJokeZLrSrjtb49eomBkqQRYC3K6CEK39PeMqjXqDz\nRYC3K6CEK39PeMqjXqDzhyUmW%2Bj0PyLlfQdhG1WOTUUVr0k6JzISssw8vOKtwY6sAFKOK7aFNGu8IgnDLvd6YDiaUg6mk89L%2FN7xLw3wRj1sC46Kcg2378K1JlYB1CboKLnKS9yWyKTDfVqR%2Fjn23xA026H5lPP79Q3volNnLX4eRqO%2FIjw0zLwPazy%2FGkQ2lUGBHeL25m90swTiqiKdJvuR3yLAbGtlRFTRDog6ECtdw7hwNqzn0Q\nTRDog6ECtdw7hwNqzn0QqTd%2FCgZSVQkGVEzT7KNNkJ1sJ0KutFIIEt5LYbfxb%2FfeuCeoju%2BR2Dw%3D%3D&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22companies_house_document.pdf%22&X-Amz-Signature=8f5ace40df3e56ecd545aea6b13249119277faf0bfd\n6b13249119277faf0bfd3263b9351503f7cc70155>\nas posted by OnlyFans’ parent company, Fenix International.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.64809686), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='d16d0eb3-1a19-4809-8e9c-d81985622fec', embedding=None, metadata={'id': '448f9c236582c7f43f7ea0a558601828ffcebb210af7dfa1a460a49dc91ab467-5', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': '448f9c236582c7f43f7ea0a558601828ffcebb210af7dfa1a460a49dc91ab467', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20240809, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-08', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1296839702.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2024, 'date_month': 8, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/2024/08/09/corcentric-mergers-payments-flywire-ncontracts-private-equity-volatility/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 9, 'title': 'Corcentric, valued at $1.2 billion in 2021, could sell for less than 50% of that as U.S. deals remain slow', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/2024/08/09/corcentric-mergers-payments-flywire-ncontracts-private-equity-volatility/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='There’s also Ncontracts, which has been up for sale for several weeks and is near securing a buyer, according to four banking and PE sources.

He did have the opportunity to name a friend’s chocolate labrador once—a rare occasion where he could run wild, free from the constraints of trademark availability and client feedback.\n\nShore named the labrador after a brand of chocolate syrup he remembers fondly from his childhood: Bosco.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/professional-namer-anthony-shore-accenture-rename-career/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/professional-namer-anthony-shore-accenture-rename-career/\n\nSource 2:\no2c%2BTk%2Be8U9lGRaTTu9RDonUymZ5AqlVr0Y94dKC5GnI4dNhgfIGfGQoH5HdTJ52hDQrFpCTWgE%2F8MtCJQNo%2FRQsGoMwT6wgLeMZAYlQ1FSH%2F8p%2F%2BZhI6kVmacdijv4STSzSuwRDs%2FmNT%2BUDXABkdhSFRPIClKcaXYqaQZm3IIwCrY1QKqYEJ8Ez3pY5W4814AQLPJokeZLrSrjtb49eomBkqQRYC3K6CEK39PeMqjXqDz\nRYC3K6CEK39PeMqjXqDzhyUmW%2Bj0PyLlfQdhG1WOTUUVr0k6JzISssw8vOKtwY6sAFKOK7aFNGu8IgnDLvd6YDiaUg6mk89L%2FN7xLw3wRj1sC46Kcg2378K1JlYB1CboKLnKS9yWyKTDfVqR%2Fjn23xA026H5lPP79Q3volNnLX4eRqO%2FIjw0zLwPazy%2FGkQ2lUGBHeL25m90swTiqiKdJvuR3yLAbGtlRFTRDog6ECtdw7hwNqzn0Q\nTRDog6ECtdw7hwNqzn0QqTd%2FCgZSVQkGVEzT7KNNkJ1sJ0KutFIIEt5LYbfxb%2FfeuCeoju%2BR2Dw%3D%3D&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22companies_house_document.pdf%22&X-Amz-Signature=8f5ace40df3e56ecd545aea6b13249119277faf0bfd\n6b13249119277faf0bfd3263b9351503f7cc70155>\nas posted by OnlyFans’ parent company, Fenix International.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/12/onlyfans-reveals-record-breaking-revenue-6-6-billion-2023/\n\nSource 3:\nThere’s also Ncontracts, which has been up for sale for several weeks and is near securing a buyer, according to four banking and PE sources.

Yet this company, General Electric <https://fortune.com/company/general-electric/> (GE), is No. 1 on our list once again, the most admired company for the sixth time in the past decade. (It last reached the top slot in 2002.) And if you\'re wondering whether we\'ve got some pro-GE bias in our survey—nope. GE has also ranked No. 1 in the Financial Times\' "most respected" survey for seven of the past eight years, and it topped a recent Barron\'s ranking of most admired companies. The results speak for themselves. But why does the world love this company so much? The answer lies in the fact that our survey (like the others) is a poll not of consumers but of businesspeople working in the same hard world as GE.

Yet this company, General Electric <https://fortune.com/company/general-electric/> (GE), is No. 1 on our list once again, the most admired company for the sixth time in the past decade. (It last reached the top slot in 2002.) And if you\'re wondering whether we\'ve got some pro-GE bias in our survey—nope. GE has also ranked No. 1 in the Financial Times\' "most respected" survey for seven of the past eight years, and it topped a recent Barron\'s ranking of most admired companies. The results speak for themselves. But why does the world love this company so much? The answer lies in the fact that our survey (like the others) is a poll not of consumers but of businesspeople working in the same hard world as GE.

Yet this company, General Electric <https://fortune.com/company/general-electric/> (GE), is No. 1 on our list once again, the most admired company for the sixth time in the past decade. (It last reached the top slot in 2002.) And if you\'re wondering whether we\'ve got some pro-GE bias in our survey—nope. GE has also ranked No. 1 in the Financial Times\' "most respected" survey for seven of the past eight years, and it topped a recent Barron\'s ranking of most admired companies. The results speak for themselves. But why does the world love this company so much? The answer lies in the fact that our survey (like the others) is a poll not of consumers but of businesspeople working in the same hard world as GE.

Yet this company, General Electric <https://fortune.com/company/general-electric/> (GE), is No. 1 on our list once again, the most admired company for the sixth time in the past decade. (It last reached the top slot in 2002.) And if you\'re wondering whether we\'ve got some pro-GE bias in our survey—nope. GE has also ranked No. 1 in the Financial Times\' "most respected" survey for seven of the past eight years, and it topped a recent Barron\'s ranking of most admired companies. The results speak for themselves. But why does the world love this company so much?
