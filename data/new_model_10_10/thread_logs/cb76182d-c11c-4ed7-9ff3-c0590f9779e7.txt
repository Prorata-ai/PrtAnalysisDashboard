In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials. The second discovery was that there are extensive irregularities in gravity over the earth, like great shallow hills and bowls.

Only gradually, over a period of about a billion years, did it heat up to the molten state through compression and radioactivity. The amount of contraction that could have occurred in cooling off since then is not sufficient to account for the earth's mountain heights and ocean depths. Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat, because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat. A newer theory is that the earth is actually expanding. This was first suggested about a quarter of a century ago, on purely cosmic grounds, by the great British theoretical physicist, P.A.M. Dirac. He reasoned that in an expanding universe, in which all bodies are seen to be rushing away from one another at a measurable rate, the force of gravity in any given body must be gradually diminishing with age. Even a slight decrease in the earth's gravity, unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means, could cause its matter to expand by as much as 1,100 miles in circumference in 3.25 billion years.

(The agency was not able to immediately respond to questions, but recommended Edwards as a source.)

In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above.

Only gradually, over a period of about a billion years, did it heat up to the molten state through compression and radioactivity. The amount of contraction that could have occurred in cooling off since then is not sufficient to account for the earth's mountain heights and ocean depths. Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat, because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat. A newer theory is that the earth is actually expanding. This was first suggested about a quarter of a century ago, on purely cosmic grounds, by the great British theoretical physicist, P.A.M. Dirac. He reasoned that in an expanding universe, in which all bodies are seen to be rushing away from one another at a measurable rate, the force of gravity in any given body must be gradually diminishing with age. Even a slight decrease in the earth's gravity, unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means, could cause its matter to expand by as much as 1,100 miles in circumference in 3.25 billion years.

In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials. The second discovery was that there are extensive irregularities in gravity over the earth, like great shallow hills and bowls.

Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat, because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat. A newer theory is that the earth is actually expanding. This was first suggested about a quarter of a century ago, on purely cosmic grounds, by the great British theoretical physicist, P.A.M. Dirac. He reasoned that in an expanding universe, in which all bodies are seen to be rushing away from one another at a measurable rate, the force of gravity in any given body must be gradually diminishing with age. Even a slight decrease in the earth's gravity, unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means, could cause its matter to expand by as much as 1,100 miles in circumference in 3.25 billion years.

In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials. The second discovery was that there are extensive irregularities in gravity over the earth, like great shallow hills and bowls.

Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat, because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat. A newer theory is that the earth is actually expanding. This was first suggested about a quarter of a century ago, on purely cosmic grounds, by the great British theoretical physicist, P.A.M. Dirac. He reasoned that in an expanding universe, in which all bodies are seen to be rushing away from one another at a measurable rate, the force of gravity in any given body must be gradually diminishing with age. Even a slight decrease in the earth's gravity, unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means, could cause its matter to expand by as much as 1,100 miles in circumference in 3.25 billion years.

In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials. The second discovery was that there are extensive irregularities in gravity over the earth, like great shallow hills and bowls. Eight major gravity anomalies have been located, the two greatest being a deep depression or "bowl"\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/solving-the-riddle-of-the-shuddering-earth-fortune-classics-1965/\n\nSource 1:\ncold accretion of dust and gases whirling in a primordial disk around the sun. Only gradually, over a period of about a billion years, did it heat up to the molten state through compression and radioactivity. The amount of contraction that could have occurred in cooling off since then is not sufficient to account for the earth\'s mountain heights and ocean depths. Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat, because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat. A newer theory is that the earth is actually expanding. This was first suggested about a quarter of a century ago, on purely cosmic grounds, by the great British theoretical physicist, P.A.M. Dirac. He reasoned that in an expanding universe, in which all bodies are seen to be rushing away from one another at a measurable rate, the force of gravity in any given body must be gradually diminishing with age. Even a slight decrease in the earth\'s gravity, unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means, could cause its matter to expand by as much as 1,100 miles in circumference in 3.25 billion years. The expansion theory, long dormant, suddenly gained support from the discovery of the\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/solving-the-riddle-of-the-shuddering-earth-fortune-classics-1965/\n\nSource 2:\n“The centrifugal force will balance the force of the gravity,” says Dennis Wright, president of the Seattle-based International Space Elevator Consortium <https://www.isec.org/> (ISEC), which has studied and hosted conferences on the topic for two decades. “And it will stretch this cable tight and provide a vertical railroad, if you will, for vehicles that can grip the cable to climb up and down and deliver payloads.”\n\nThese climbers, traveling at speeds of a fast train, perhaps around 120 to 200 mph, could carry, for example, a 15-ton satellite every day or every other day. It could bring back from space, satellites and elements mined from asteroids. Such a vehicle might also carry tourists, of course, and it would be available every day, unburdened by rocket launch windows dependent on ideal conditions. “It changes everything. It’s just a completely different world,” says Edwards.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\nWith the space elevator, no such fuel loads are needed. “You\'ll just use whatever electrical mechanism you have (on climbers) to get you up there,” plus a little fuel to correct positioning from time to time, Cohen said. “Right now, we have astronauts stuck 400 kilometers away and we\'re like help is on the way, just wait six months.”\n\nNASA, fairly famously risk-averse, heard out Edwards but hasn’t moved on the idea. (The agency was not able to immediately respond to questions, but recommended Edwards as a source.) Wright says several countries have at least studied the concept, including China and Japan—the Obayashi Corp. commitment is real enough.\n\nBut it may take international cooperation to actually get a space elevator built, in part because, without nations working together, there is always the chance of piracy or use of the idea for military advantage. There are also basic concerns like weather-related events, problems largely mitigated by locating the base, or the “Earth port,” near the equator in a specific region of the Pacific Ocean. “None of these seems to be showstoppers,” says Cohen. "So until someone finds one that has no solution, then I think onward.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\n“I think we have overcome the major problems (related to the space elevator),” says Yoji Ishikawa, an aerospace engineer in Japan who played a key role in developing Obayashi’s concept.

It’s like that. \n\n“It’s like a roller coaster, where you’re building the track yourself,” Marcus tells me once we’re back on the ground.

In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials. The second discovery was that there are extensive irregularities in gravity over the earth, like great shallow hills and bowls. Eight major gravity anomalies have been located, the two greatest being a deep depression or "bowl"\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/solving-the-riddle-of-the-shuddering-earth-fortune-classics-1965/\n\nSource 1:\ncold accretion of dust and gases whirling in a primordial disk around the sun. Only gradually, over a period of about a billion years, did it heat up to the molten state through compression and radioactivity. The amount of contraction that could have occurred in cooling off since then is not sufficient to account for the earth\'s mountain heights and ocean depths. Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat, because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat. A newer theory is that the earth is actually expanding. This was first suggested about a quarter of a century ago, on purely cosmic grounds, by the great British theoretical physicist, P.A.M. Dirac. He reasoned that in an expanding universe, in which all bodies are seen to be rushing away from one another at a measurable rate, the force of gravity in any given body must be gradually diminishing with age. Even a slight decrease in the earth\'s gravity, unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means, could cause its matter to expand by as much as 1,100 miles in circumference in 3.25 billion years. The expansion theory, long dormant, suddenly gained support from the discovery of the\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/solving-the-riddle-of-the-shuddering-earth-fortune-classics-1965/\n\nSource 2:\n“The centrifugal force will balance the force of the gravity,” says Dennis Wright, president of the Seattle-based International Space Elevator Consortium <https://www.isec.org/> (ISEC), which has studied and hosted conferences on the topic for two decades. “And it will stretch this cable tight and provide a vertical railroad, if you will, for vehicles that can grip the cable to climb up and down and deliver payloads.”\n\nThese climbers, traveling at speeds of a fast train, perhaps around 120 to 200 mph, could carry, for example, a 15-ton satellite every day or every other day. It could bring back from space, satellites and elements mined from asteroids. Such a vehicle might also carry tourists, of course, and it would be available every day, unburdened by rocket launch windows dependent on ideal conditions. “It changes everything. It’s just a completely different world,” says Edwards.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\nWith the space elevator, no such fuel loads are needed. “You\'ll just use whatever electrical mechanism you have (on climbers) to get you up there,” plus a little fuel to correct positioning from time to time, Cohen said. “Right now, we have astronauts stuck 400 kilometers away and we\'re like help is on the way, just wait six months.”\n\nNASA, fairly famously risk-averse, heard out Edwards but hasn’t moved on the idea. (The agency was not able to immediately respond to questions, but recommended Edwards as a source.) Wright says several countries have at least studied the concept, including China and Japan—the Obayashi Corp. commitment is real enough.\n\nBut it may take international cooperation to actually get a space elevator built, in part because, without nations working together, there is always the chance of piracy or use of the idea for military advantage. There are also basic concerns like weather-related events, problems largely mitigated by locating the base, or the “Earth port,” near the equator in a specific region of the Pacific Ocean. “None of these seems to be showstoppers,” says Cohen. "So until someone finds one that has no solution, then I think onward.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\n“I think we have overcome the major problems (related to the space elevator),” says Yoji Ishikawa, an aerospace engineer in Japan who played a key role in developing Obayashi’s concept.

In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials. The second discovery was that there are extensive irregularities in gravity over the earth, like great shallow hills and bowls. Eight major gravity anomalies have been located, the two greatest being a deep depression or "bowl"\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/solving-the-riddle-of-the-shuddering-earth-fortune-classics-1965/\n\nSource 1:\ncold accretion of dust and gases whirling in a primordial disk around the sun. Only gradually, over a period of about a billion years, did it heat up to the molten state through compression and radioactivity. The amount of contraction that could have occurred in cooling off since then is not sufficient to account for the earth\'s mountain heights and ocean depths. Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat, because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat. A newer theory is that the earth is actually expanding. This was first suggested about a quarter of a century ago, on purely cosmic grounds, by the great British theoretical physicist, P.A.M. Dirac. He reasoned that in an expanding universe, in which all bodies are seen to be rushing away from one another at a measurable rate, the force of gravity in any given body must be gradually diminishing with age. Even a slight decrease in the earth\'s gravity, unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means, could cause its matter to expand by as much as 1,100 miles in circumference in 3.25 billion years. The expansion theory, long dormant, suddenly gained support from the discovery of the\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/solving-the-riddle-of-the-shuddering-earth-fortune-classics-1965/\n\nSource 2:\n“The centrifugal force will balance the force of the gravity,” says Dennis Wright, president of the Seattle-based International Space Elevator Consortium <https://www.isec.org/> (ISEC), which has studied and hosted conferences on the topic for two decades. “And it will stretch this cable tight and provide a vertical railroad, if you will, for vehicles that can grip the cable to climb up and down and deliver payloads.”\n\nThese climbers, traveling at speeds of a fast train, perhaps around 120 to 200 mph, could carry, for example, a 15-ton satellite every day or every other day. It could bring back from space, satellites and elements mined from asteroids. Such a vehicle might also carry tourists, of course, and it would be available every day, unburdened by rocket launch windows dependent on ideal conditions. “It changes everything. It’s just a completely different world,” says Edwards.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\nWith the space elevator, no such fuel loads are needed. “You\'ll just use whatever electrical mechanism you have (on climbers) to get you up there,” plus a little fuel to correct positioning from time to time, Cohen said. “Right now, we have astronauts stuck 400 kilometers away and we\'re like help is on the way, just wait six months.”\n\nNASA, fairly famously risk-averse, heard out Edwards but hasn’t moved on the idea. (The agency was not able to immediately respond to questions, but recommended Edwards as a source.) Wright says several countries have at least studied the concept, including China and Japan—the Obayashi Corp. commitment is real enough.\n\nBut it may take international cooperation to actually get a space elevator built, in part because, without nations working together, there is always the chance of piracy or use of the idea for military advantage. There are also basic concerns like weather-related events, problems largely mitigated by locating the base, or the “Earth port,” near the equator in a specific region of the Pacific Ocean. “None of these seems to be showstoppers,” says Cohen. "So until someone finds one that has no solution, then I think onward.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\n“I think we have overcome the major problems (related to the space elevator),” says Yoji Ishikawa, an aerospace engineer in Japan who played a key role in developing Obayashi’s concept. The company’s planned 2025 construction start is on hold, Ishikawa says, as he looks for both international support and "many different industries to come together.”\nA space elevator could be used to get objects up to geosynchronous orbit (GEO), possibly as fast as a week’s time.

2024-11-08 12:29:57,789: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there was no gravity, the consequences would be far-reaching and dramatic. According to [1], the earth's gravity is what keeps us and everything else on its surface. Without gravity, the earth's matter would not be bound together, and the planet would likely break apart. The concept of a solid, rigid earth would cease to exist, and the very fabric of our reality would be altered.

In the absence of gravity, objects would not fall towards the ground, and there would be no weight or resistance to movement. This means that everything, including humans, would be floating freely, untethered from the earth's surface [2]. The idea of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning, and our daily lives would be unrecognizable. Even the simplest tasks, like walking or eating, would become impossible without gravity to provide a sense of direction and stability.

Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also have a profound impact on the earth

2024-11-08 12:29:57,954: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there was no gravity, the consequences would be far-reaching and dramatic. According to [1], the earth's gravity is what keeps us and everything else on its surface. Without gravity, the earth's matter would not be bound together, and the planet would likely break apart. The concept of a solid, rigid earth would cease to exist, and the very fabric of our reality would be altered.

In the absence of gravity, objects would not fall towards the ground, and there would be no weight or resistance to movement. This means that everything, including humans, would be floating freely, untethered from the earth's surface [2]. The idea of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning, and our daily lives would be unrecognizable. Even the simplest tasks, like walking or eating, would become impossible without gravity to provide a sense of direction and stability.

Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also have a profound impact on the earth's atmosphere. Without gravity, the air molecules would not be held in place, and the atmosphere would slowly drift into space [1].

In the absence of gravity, objects would not fall towards the ground, and there would be no weight or resistance to movement. This means that everything, including humans, would be floating freely, untethered from the earth's surface [2]. The idea of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning, and our daily lives would be unrecognizable. Even the simplest tasks, like walking or eating, would become impossible without gravity to provide a sense of direction and stability.

Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also have a profound impact on the earth's atmosphere. Without gravity, the air molecules would not be held in place, and the atmosphere would slowly drift into space [1].

Even the simplest tasks, like walking or eating, would become impossible without gravity to provide a sense of direction and stability.

Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also have a profound impact on the earth's atmosphere. Without gravity, the air molecules would not be held in place, and the atmosphere would slowly drift into space [1].

According to [1], the earth's gravity is what keeps us and everything else on its surface. Without gravity, the earth's matter would not be bound together, and the planet would likely break apart. The concept of a solid, rigid earth would cease to exist, and the very fabric of our reality would be altered.

In the absence of gravity, objects would not fall towards the ground, and there would be no weight or resistance to movement. This means that everything, including humans, would be floating freely, untethered from the earth's surface [2]. The idea of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning, and our daily lives would be unrecognizable. Even the simplest tasks, like walking or eating, would become impossible without gravity to provide a sense of direction and stability.

Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also have a profound impact on the earth's atmosphere. Without gravity, the air molecules would not be held in place, and the atmosphere would slowly drift into space [1]. This would make it impossible for life as we know it to exist, as the necessary gases and elements would be lost to the void. In essence, a world without gravity would be a world without structure, without direction, and without life as we know it.
