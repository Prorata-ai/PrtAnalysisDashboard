Typically, data is encrypted in transit and in storage—say, on a hard drive. But then that data—for instance, a batch of sensitive customer information—must be decrypted for processing. That leaves it vulnerable to theft. By contrast, FHE is end-to-end encryption that secures data while it’s in use. The data itself is accessible only to the holder of the decryption key.\n\nIn principle, a superior FHE engine could encrypt a query you type into Google, Smart says: “Google would do the search for you, not know what the response was, send the response to you, and you would decrypt it.”\n\nZama, which recently raised $73 million in Series A funding, builds FHE solutions for blockchain <https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain>, the online ledger used to record transactions.

But that\'s by no means its only purpose. In its broader applications, blockchain provides the technical underpinnings for an entirely new approach to the internet. \n\nThis new internet architecture, often referred to as web3, represents a new social contract. Web3 blockchains empower and are owned by individuals, whether consumers or creators—rather than leaving them and their data at the mercy of dominant players like Microsoft/OpenAI, Google, and all those other LLM developers treating our data as raw material for their business models. \n\nBlockchains are essentially a system of contracts operating as a public, immutable ledger that can protect intellectual property. Every creation can be permanently time-stamped and attributed to its rightful owner. This safeguards artists’ work from unauthorized use while also allowing them to maintain control over their intellectual property, tracking its use in training LLMs, and even enabling transparent royalty sharing for newly created works.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/04/ai-change-music-industry-apple-tech-entertainment/\n\nSource 7:\na New York-based startup that makes it easy to create websites.

Blockchains, databases which we can all use and inspect with transparency, are growing increasingly scalable and will be ready for large-scale applications soon, and web3 is the natural evolution of the internet and web technologies. Blockchain can be orders of magnitude more secure than current internet protocols because it is built on cryptography from the bottom up and it is fundamentally user-centric, with shared trust rather than hierarchical trust.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/17/200-top-ceos-reveal-how-ai-is-already-transforming-their-sectors-at-yale-summit/'}

Typically, data is encrypted in transit and in storage—say, on a hard drive. But then that data—for instance, a batch of sensitive customer information—must be decrypted for processing. That leaves it vulnerable to theft. By contrast, FHE is end-to-end encryption that secures data while it’s in use. The data itself is accessible only to the holder of the decryption key.\n\nIn principle, a superior FHE engine could encrypt a query you type into Google, Smart says: “Google would do the search for you, not know what the response was, send the response to you, and you would decrypt it.”\n\nZama, which recently raised $73 million in Series A funding, builds FHE solutions for blockchain <https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain>, the online ledger used to record transactions. Smart gives the example of a blockchain showing client activity for various banks. To prevent them from seeing one another’s accounts, Zama would add a layer on top of the chain that encrypts all the important stuff, while still allowing data processing.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/26/besides-keeping-data-safe-this-emerging-tech-could-be-a-key-trust-builder-for-businesses/\n\nSource 3:\n"If the lights went out in this building, we’d be trying to figure out what the heck went on," said Gupta.

It’s about a new approach to the internet, based on blockchain technology and often styled as “web3,” that will improve the online foundation that we all use every day to transact, communicate, keep our families safe, and conduct many of the tasks of our day-to-day lives.\n\nCryptocurrency is just one application of the blockchain, a series of technologies that form a more secure internet as an autonomous platform layer for applications, products, and services.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/26/presidential-campaigns-votes-50-million-crypto-investors-america-blockchain-real-benefits-tech-politics/\n\nSource 2:\nLet me try to explain that mouthful, with help from Smart. Typically, data is encrypted in transit and in storage—say, on a hard drive. But then that data—for instance, a batch of sensitive customer information—must be decrypted for processing. That leaves it vulnerable to theft. By contrast, FHE is end-to-end encryption that secures data while it’s in use. The data itself is accessible only to the holder of the decryption key.\n\nIn principle, a superior FHE engine could encrypt a query you type into Google, Smart says: “Google would do the search for you, not know what the response was, send the response to you, and you would decrypt it.”\n\nZama, which recently raised $73 million in Series A funding, builds FHE solutions for blockchain <https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain>, the online ledger used to record transactions. Smart gives the example of a blockchain showing client activity for various banks. To prevent them from seeing one another’s accounts, Zama would add a layer on top of the chain that encrypts all the important stuff, while still allowing data processing.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/26/besides-keeping-data-safe-this-emerging-tech-could-be-a-key-trust-builder-for-businesses/\n\nSource 3:\n"If the lights went out in this building, we’d be trying to figure out what the heck went on," said Gupta. "There would be some number of steps we’d have to take to figure out what had happened and when it’s coming back. But it would be a lot better if there was something we could text quickly asking, \'Why did the lights go out?\'"\n\nNow, if you apply this to the internet, it goes something like this.\n\n"It can be as disruptive if the internet goes out as if the electricity goes out at this point," said Gupta. "So, if somebody has the ability to ask why the internet’s not working, and the answer can come back after running a quick query, that’s a fundamentally different picture than what we currently have."\n\nI’ve seen Command in a real-time demo, one that felt rather fast to me but that Anil assured me could be faster.

But that\'s by no means its only purpose. In its broader applications, blockchain provides the technical underpinnings for an entirely new approach to the internet. \n\nThis new internet architecture, often referred to as web3, represents a new social contract. Web3 blockchains empower and are owned by individuals, whether consumers or creators—rather than leaving them and their data at the mercy of dominant players like Microsoft/OpenAI, Google, and all those other LLM developers treating our data as raw material for their business models. \n\nBlockchains are essentially a system of contracts operating as a public, immutable ledger that can protect intellectual property. Every creation can be permanently time-stamped and attributed to its rightful owner. This safeguards artists’ work from unauthorized use while also allowing them to maintain control over their intellectual property, tracking its use in training LLMs, and even enabling transparent royalty sharing for newly created works.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/04/ai-change-music-industry-apple-tech-entertainment/\n\nSource 7:\na New York-based startup that makes it easy to create websites.

According to Source 9, the World Wide Web is a subset of the Internet where interactive documents that can include text, photos, and sound are connected by hypertext links [9]. This suggests that the web is a system of interlinked documents, but it doesn't provide information about the "HTTP" acronym.

Source 6 mentions web3, which represents a new social contract and is built on blockchain technology [6]. While this provides context about the evolution of the internet, it doesn't explain what "HTTP" stands for.

According to Source 9, the World Wide Web is a subset of the Internet where interactive documents that can include text, photos, and sound are connected by hypertext links [9]. This suggests that the web is a system of interlinked documents, but it doesn't provide information about the "HTTP" acronym.

Source 6 mentions web3, which represents a new social contract and is built on blockchain technology [6]. While this provides context about the evolution of the internet, it doesn't explain what "HTTP" stands for.

If you have any additional information or context about HTTP, I may be able to help you better.
