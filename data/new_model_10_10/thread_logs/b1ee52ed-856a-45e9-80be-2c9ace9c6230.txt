Last year during an appearance on his own podcast, Unconfuse Me with Bill Gates <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_3YPvGIAR0>, alongside guests comedian Seth Rogen and Rogen’s wife, Lauren Miller Rogen, Gates revealed he had once ranked himself against others <https://fortune.com/2023/08/04/bill-gates-compete-colleagues-sleep-little-as-possible-lazy-unnecessary/> in terms of how much time he had had seemingly wasted by sleeping.\n\n“In my thirties and forties when there would be a conversation about sleep it would be like ‘Oh,, I only sleep six hours,\'” Gates told the couple. “And the other guy says ‘Oh, I only sleep five,’ then ‘Well, sometimes I don’t sleep at all.’ \n\n“I’d be like ‘Wow, those guys are so good, I have to try harder because sleep is laziness and unnecessary.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/bill-gates-warren-buffett-calendar-lesson/\n\nSource 4:\nYears later, Gates, now worth $154 billion per the Bloomberg Billionaire\'s Index <https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/william-h-gates/#:~:text=%23%206%20Bill%20Gates%20%24154B>, says he has realized good sleep is "super important" for brain health, a topic which has increased in importance for him following the death of his father, Bill Gates Sr., who died at home in September 2020 <https://www.gatesnotes.com/Remembering-Bill-Gates-Sr> after a battle with Alzheimer’s. <https://www.threads.net/@thisisbillgates/post/C7URBCXxLzv> <https://www.threads.net/@thisisbillgates/post/C7URBCXxLzv>\n Post by @thisisbillgates  View on Threads <https://www.threads.net/@thisisbillgates/post/C7URBCXxLzv>\nBut Gates didn\'t just push himself to the extreme—he expected the same of his staff.

In the early days of Microsoft, my office overlooked the parking lot—and I would keep track of who was leaving early and staying late. But as I got older—and especially once I became a father—I realized there is more to life than work."\n\nThe Buffett method\n\nA turning point at which Gates, a father of three, may have decided to switch up his schedule was after learning how Berkshire Hathaway <https://fortune.com/company/berkshire-hathaway/> CEO Warren Buffett manages his time.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/bill-gates-warren-buffett-calendar-lesson/\n\nSource 5:\n"And I reflect on the luck I had <https://fortune.com/2023/12/09/bill-gates-elon-musk-hardcore-leadership/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks> to be born to a great family in a time of historic technological change and optimism, and to come of age just as the personal computer revolution was taking off."\n\nBill\'s best friend\n\nAlthough Gates doesn\'t expand on who the individual he lost at a young age is, the father of three has previously spoken about the death of his best friend in an accident at the age of 17. \n\nKent Evans was Gates\'s first business partner when the duo were in the eighth grade. The pair began working out of a school computer lab to program the payroll for a local company.\n\nIn the 2019 Netflix <https://fortune.com/company/netflix/> special Inside Bill\'s Brain, Gates revealed he still knows Evans\'s phone number by heart.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/bill-gates-source-code-autobiography-teenage-college-misfit/\n\nSource 6:\nBut he still plans on staying busy, telling CNBC <https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/07/bill-gates-retirement-sounds-awful-ill-work-like-warren-buffett.html> earlier that he intends to keep working for at least another two decades <https://fortune.com/2024/09/09/bill-gates-retirement-awful-warren-buffett/> if his health allows—following in the footsteps of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett <https://fortune.com/2024/08/04/warren-buffett-philanthrophy-berkshre-hathaway-stock-bill-melinda-french-gates-foundation/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks>.

Gates, along with Paul Allen, founded Microsoft—a company that has had a lasting impact on the software industry, and Big Tech itself. Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/> now boasts a $3.1 trillion market capitalization.\nDuring his tenure building Microsoft, Gates infamously “didn’t believe in vacations <https://fortune.com/2024/04/04/bill-gates-microsoft-tips-business-success/>” and worked on weekends. That same level of intensity allegedly bled into the philanthropic foundation he created with his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates <https://fortune.com/tag/melinda-gates/>, according to an excerpt <https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-melinda-gates-stressful-work-culture-gates-foundation-book-excerpt-2024-8> from Billionaire, Nerd, Savior, King: Bill Gates and His Quest to Shape Our World\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/16/bill-gates-terrified-employees-at-foundation-anupreeta-das-book-claims/\n\nSource 1:\nfrom Billionaire, Nerd, Savior, King: Bill Gates and His Quest to Shape Our World <https://www.amazon.com/Billionaire-Nerd-Savior-King-Gates/dp/1668006723?campaign_id=4&emc=edit_dk_20240605&instance_id=125428&nl=dealbook&regi_id=194893788&segment_id=168753&te=1&user_id=2259c117e2d6d1f3b6de8de6262da403&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2F&asc_source=browser&asc_campaign=commerce-pra&tag=bi-auto-72116-20> by Anupreeta Das <https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Anupreeta-Das/193423339>, published by Business Insider last week.

As of 2023, Gates and his ex-wife Melinda French Gates had donated $59.5 billion <https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/foundation-fact-sheet> to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, turning it into the one of the world’s largest charitable foundations. In 2010, Gates also cocreated the Giving Pledge <https://givingpledge.org/about> with French Gates and investor Warren Buffett, and has promised to give away most of his wealth during his lifetime. \n\nAlthough Steve Ballmer’s holdings have made him one of the richest men in the world, when he joined as the company’s 30th employee in 1980, he didn’t get a single share. After dropping out of Stanford Business School, he served as a quasi–personal assistant to Bill Gates with the unimpressive title “business manager,” Forbes reported.\n\nYet, because Microsoft was looking to grow rapidly at the time, Gates and his cofounder, Paul Allen, agreed to give Ballmer 10% of the profit growth he generated on top of his $50,000 yearly salary.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/steve-ballmer-net-worth-bill-gates-sixth-richest-man-microsoft/\n\nSource 3:\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, helping achieve this goal will mean a lot of work, which is why Gates is eyeing “at least 10 years, if my health allows, working at this level.”\n\n“Hopefully it’ll be more like 20 or 30," he added.\n\nChange of pace\n\nWhile Gates intends to continue working at a high level, he won\'t do so with the same tenacity as he did when he launched Microsoft.\n\nWhile launching the $2.99 trillion behemoth with childhood friend Paul Allen, Gates would stand in his office overlooking the car park to see which of his employees were leaving first. \n\nSleeping as little as possible became something of a competition with peers <https://fortune.com/2023/08/04/bill-gates-compete-colleagues-sleep-little-as-possible-lazy-unnecessary/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks>, the man worth $157 billion <https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/william-h-gates/> said on his podcast Unconfuse Me With Bill Gates <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_3YPvGIAR0> last year.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/09/bill-gates-retirement-awful-warren-buffett/\n\nSource 3:\nBill Gates Sr. died at home in September 2020 <https://www.gatesnotes.com/Remembering-Bill-Gates-Sr> after a battle with Alzheimer’s that had begun more than a decade prior.\n\n“I spent yesterday on Alzheimer’s disease,” Gates told CNBC. “Intellectually, in terms of staying up to date—even just on [artificial intelligence] alone—takes a lot of time. But it’s still incredibly fulfilling.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/09/bill-gates-retirement-awful-warren-buffett/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/09/bill-gates-retirement-awful-warren-buffett/\n\nSource 4:\nThe 68-year-old entrepreneur and philanthropist has been open with his reflections about his working life at Microsoft, and the things he would do differently if he had his time over. Last year during an appearance on his own podcast, Unconfuse Me with Bill Gates <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_3YPvGIAR0>, alongside guests comedian Seth Rogen and Rogen’s wife, Lauren Miller Rogen, Gates revealed he had once ranked himself against others <https://fortune.com/2023/08/04/bill-gates-compete-colleagues-sleep-little-as-possible-lazy-unnecessary/> in terms of how much time he had had seemingly wasted by sleeping.\n\n“In my thirties and forties when there would be a conversation about sleep it would be like ‘Oh,, I only sleep six hours,\'” Gates told the couple. “And the other guy says ‘Oh, I only sleep five,’ then ‘Well, sometimes I don’t sleep at all.’ \n\n“I’d be like ‘Wow, those guys are so good, I have to try harder because sleep is laziness and unnecessary.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/bill-gates-warren-buffett-calendar-lesson/\n\nSource 4:\nYears later, Gates, now worth $154 billion per the Bloomberg Billionaire\'s Index <https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/william-h-gates/#:~:text=%23%206%20Bill%20Gates%20%24154B>, says he has realized good sleep is "super important" for brain health, a topic which has increased in importance for him following the death of his father, Bill Gates Sr., who died at home in September 2020 <https://www.gatesnotes.com/Remembering-Bill-Gates-Sr> after a battle with Alzheimer’s. <https://www.threads.net/@thisisbillgates/post/C7URBCXxLzv> <https://www.threads.net/@thisisbillgates/post/C7URBCXxLzv>\n Post by @thisisbillgates  View on Threads <https://www.threads.net/@thisisbillgates/post/C7URBCXxLzv>\nBut Gates didn\'t just push himself to the extreme—he expected the same of his staff. Last year Gates told graduates <https://fortune.com/2023/05/15/bill-gates-work-life-balance-commencement-speech-relationships-slacking/> from Northern Arizona University that when he was their age he simply "didn\'t believe" in vacations or weekends.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/bill-gates-warren-buffett-calendar-lesson/\n\nSource 4:\nHe told the students <https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/05/bill-gates-advices-graduating-students/#:~:text=I%20didn\'t%20believe%20in%20weekends.,more%20to%20life%20than%20work.> in May: "I pushed everyone around me to work very long hours. In the early days of Microsoft, my office overlooked the parking lot—and I would keep track of who was leaving early and staying late. But as I got older—and especially once I became a father—I realized there is more to life than work."\n\nThe Buffett method\n\nA turning point at which Gates, a father of three, may have decided to switch up his schedule was after learning how Berkshire Hathaway <https://fortune.com/company/berkshire-hathaway/> CEO Warren Buffett manages his time.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/bill-gates-warren-buffett-calendar-lesson/\n\nSource 5:\n"And I reflect on the luck I had <https://fortune.com/2023/12/09/bill-gates-elon-musk-hardcore-leadership/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks> to be born to a great family in a time of historic technological change and optimism, and to come of age just as the personal computer revolution was taking off."\n\nBill\'s best friend\n\nAlthough Gates doesn\'t expand on who the individual he lost at a young age is, the father of three has previously spoken about the death of his best friend in an accident at the age of 17. \n\nKent Evans was Gates\'s first business partner when the duo were in the eighth grade. The pair began working out of a school computer lab to program the payroll for a local company.\n\nIn the 2019 Netflix <https://fortune.com/company/netflix/> special Inside Bill\'s Brain, Gates revealed he still knows Evans\'s phone number by heart.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/bill-gates-source-code-autobiography-teenage-college-misfit/\n\nSource 6:\nBut he still plans on staying busy, telling CNBC <https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/07/bill-gates-retirement-sounds-awful-ill-work-like-warren-buffett.html> earlier that he intends to keep working for at least another two decades <https://fortune.com/2024/09/09/bill-gates-retirement-awful-warren-buffett/> if his health allows—following in the footsteps of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett <https://fortune.com/2024/08/04/warren-buffett-philanthrophy-berkshre-hathaway-stock-bill-melinda-french-gates-foundation/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks>.

In fact, he said that in the early days of Microsoft, he really didn’t even believe in them, Gates told Northern Arizona University <https://www.gatesnotes.com/Why-I-am-Going-to-NAU>’s graduating class in 2023.\n\n“When I was your age, I didn\'t believe in vacations.
