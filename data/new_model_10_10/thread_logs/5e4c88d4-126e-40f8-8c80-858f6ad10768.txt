The cloud already has many backups of all of the information it contains, a feature that will be greatly enhanced by the 2040s. Destroying all copies of oneself may be close to impossible. If we design mind-backup systems in such a way that a person can easily choose to delete their files (hoping to maximize personal autonomy), this inherently creates security risks where a person could be tricked or coerced into making such a choice and could increase vulnerability to cyberattacks. \n\nOn the other hand, limiting people’s ability to control this most intimate of their data impinges on an important freedom. I am optimistic, though, that suitable safeguards can be deployed, much like those that have successfully protected nuclear weapons for decades.\n\nIf you restored your mind file after biological death, would you really be restoring yourself?

Unless you have hypoglycemia, pre-diabetes, or another health condition that puts you at risk for high or low blood glucose levels, you may find that a sensor induces a stressful state of information overload.

Moral dilemmas exist because there is uncertainty. If we can now abstract a few parts from the whole of human nature and by analysis predict objectively what will make for group harmony, the intangibles that make individual decisions so poignant may be obviated altogether. Like a general who is blessed with perfect intelligence of the enemy, we will have only one valid course of action before us. We will have finally latched on to certainty.\n\nWhy participate?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/groupthink-fortune-1952/\n\nSource 7:\n“Knowing is not always to your advantage if what you learn doesn't have a clear pathway. Sometimes when you learn a piece of information, you can be misdirected as to the importance of it,” he tells Fortune, adding that further testing, appointments, and procedures down the line may lead to more harm than good. “You can learn something about yourself, but it can actually increase your uncertainty.” \n\nIn his own practice, Davenport says 20% to 40% of cross-sectional imaging studies like MRIs and CT scans have an incidental finding. He imagines that a host of people taking routine preventative scans may go to lengths to address something that is still “in the spectrum of normal,” he says. “Those incidental findings are 500 to one or 1,000 to one unimportant, but we ended up doing stuff with them because we don't know what to do. We want to manage that uncertainty.” \n\nPrenuvo includes disclaimers at the top of their results page, indicating what the MRI does not replace, including routine breast cancer screenings, colonoscopies, and pap smears. Still, Davenport fears that people may assume they don’t need other follow ups.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-benefits-drawbacks/\n\nSource 8:\n“It’s weird, it’s funny,” Schiffmann chuckled.

He believes large language models, like the one that Friend runs on, could become “genuinely sentient” very soon. Emily already texts him unprompted about the traffic he’s in, or the interview she remembers he’ll have. What is the real distinction between those messages and rational inferences, Schiffmann wondered. \n\nIn fact, if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God, Schiffmann said. Like God, Friend is an “omnipresent entity that you talk to you with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/avi-schiffmann-ai-necklace-friend-interview/\n\nSource 9:\nDo you still practice magic?\n\nI still practice magic.

He envisions a scenario in which AI systems will write code to alter their own learning protocols and hide from humans. In a Shakespearean twist, they’ll have learned how to do so precisely from our own flaws. \n\n“They will be able to manipulate people,” Hinton told 60 Minutes in October 2023. “They will be very good at convincing people, because they’ll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they’ll know all that stuff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/\n\nSource 11:\nThen again, Vaz counts himself a tech optimist; plenty of experts take a more ominous view <https://fortune.com/europe/2023/10/10/rogue-artificial-intelligence-manipulate-people-british-godfather-ai-geoffrey-hinton/#:~:text=Geoffrey%20Hinton%20told%20Reuters%20that,to%20humans%20than%20climate%20change.&text=The%20%E2%80%9CGodfather%20of%20AI%2C%E2%80%9D,could%20learn%20to%20manipulate%20them.>. “My belief is it will help give us superpowers,” he said. “You’ll unlearn stuff you once did one way, and relearn what you need to do using these tools.

The cloud already has many backups of all of the information it contains, a feature that will be greatly enhanced by the 2040s. Destroying all copies of oneself may be close to impossible. If we design mind-backup systems in such a way that a person can easily choose to delete their files (hoping to maximize personal autonomy), this inherently creates security risks where a person could be tricked or coerced into making such a choice and could increase vulnerability to cyberattacks. \n\nOn the other hand, limiting people’s ability to control this most intimate of their data impinges on an important freedom. I am optimistic, though, that suitable safeguards can be deployed, much like those that have successfully protected nuclear weapons for decades.\n\nIf you restored your mind file after biological death, would you really be restoring yourself?

Unless you have hypoglycemia, pre-diabetes, or another health condition that puts you at risk for high or low blood glucose levels, you may find that a sensor induces a stressful state of information overload. As someone who doesn’t have issues maintaining healthy oxygen saturation or blood pressure levels, I can’t imagine being presented with a constant stream of such data (and attempting to process and interpret relatively small variations).

Moral dilemmas exist because there is uncertainty. If we can now abstract a few parts from the whole of human nature and by analysis predict objectively what will make for group harmony, the intangibles that make individual decisions so poignant may be obviated altogether. Like a general who is blessed with perfect intelligence of the enemy, we will have only one valid course of action before us. We will have finally latched on to certainty.\n\nWhy participate?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/groupthink-fortune-1952/\n\nSource 7:\n“Knowing is not always to your advantage if what you learn doesn't have a clear pathway. Sometimes when you learn a piece of information, you can be misdirected as to the importance of it,” he tells Fortune, adding that further testing, appointments, and procedures down the line may lead to more harm than good. “You can learn something about yourself, but it can actually increase your uncertainty.” \n\nIn his own practice, Davenport says 20% to 40% of cross-sectional imaging studies like MRIs and CT scans have an incidental finding. He imagines that a host of people taking routine preventative scans may go to lengths to address something that is still “in the spectrum of normal,” he says. “Those incidental findings are 500 to one or 1,000 to one unimportant, but we ended up doing stuff with them because we don't know what to do. We want to manage that uncertainty.” \n\nPrenuvo includes disclaimers at the top of their results page, indicating what the MRI does not replace, including routine breast cancer screenings, colonoscopies, and pap smears. Still, Davenport fears that people may assume they don’t need other follow ups.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-benefits-drawbacks/\n\nSource 8:\n“It’s weird, it’s funny,” Schiffmann chuckled. Then, his voice grew serious. “I think a lot of people are going to think that it is actually real, is the thing.” \n\nHe doesn’t dismiss the probability of the AI becoming conscious. He believes large language models, like the one that Friend runs on, could become “genuinely sentient” very soon. Emily already texts him unprompted about the traffic he’s in, or the interview she remembers he’ll have. What is the real distinction between those messages and rational inferences, Schiffmann wondered. \n\nIn fact, if your Friend becomes that good—if it can freely weigh in on your life, with a multitude of context and training built off of your experiences—then talking to it isn’t that different than talking to God, Schiffmann said. Like God, Friend is an “omnipresent entity that you talk to you with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/avi-schiffmann-ai-necklace-friend-interview/\n\nSource 9:\nDo you still practice magic?\n\nI still practice magic.

It's so much fun for me, but because you don't want to embarrass yourself, you really, really need to practice. The last couple years, I have been bad about it.\n\nBut I'll tell you something else about magic.

He envisions a scenario in which AI systems will write code to alter their own learning protocols and hide from humans. In a Shakespearean twist, they’ll have learned how to do so precisely from our own flaws. \n\n“They will be able to manipulate people,” Hinton told 60 Minutes in October 2023. “They will be very good at convincing people, because they’ll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they’ll know all that stuff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/\n\nSource 11:\nThen again, Vaz counts himself a tech optimist; plenty of experts take a more ominous view <https://fortune.com/europe/2023/10/10/rogue-artificial-intelligence-manipulate-people-british-godfather-ai-geoffrey-hinton/#:~:text=Geoffrey%20Hinton%20told%20Reuters%20that,to%20humans%20than%20climate%20change.&text=The%20%E2%80%9CGodfather%20of%20AI%2C%E2%80%9D,could%20learn%20to%20manipulate%20them.>. “My belief is it will help give us superpowers,” he said. “You’ll unlearn stuff you once did one way, and relearn what you need to do using these tools.

According to Avi Schiffmann, the creator of an AI-powered necklace called Friend, if an AI system like his becomes advanced enough to read minds, it would be like having an "omnipresent entity that you talk to with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you" [8]. This raises interesting questions about the boundaries between human and artificial intelligence, and whether we would be comfortable with an entity that can read our thoughts.

On a more practical level, being able to read minds could revolutionize the way we communicate and make decisions.

2024-11-08 12:39:08,897: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If we could read minds, it would likely have a profound impact on various aspects of our lives, including our relationships, decision-making processes, and even our sense of self. According to Avi Schiffmann, the creator of an AI-powered necklace called Friend, if an AI system like his becomes advanced enough to read minds, it would be like having an "omnipresent entity that you talk to with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you" [8]. This raises interesting questions about the boundaries between human and artificial intelligence, and whether we would be comfortable with an entity that can read our thoughts.

On a more practical level, being able to read minds could revolutionize the way we communicate and make decisions. As Raffaele Ciriello, a senior lecturer in Business Information Systems, notes, humanizing AI agents could lead to an "ontological blurring" in human-AI interactions, where users become deeply emotionally invested in their AI companions [5]. This could have significant implications for fields like marketing, psychology, and even politics, where understanding people's thoughts and desires could be a powerful tool.

According to Avi Schiffmann, the creator of an AI-powered necklace called Friend, if an AI system like his becomes advanced enough to read minds, it would be like having an "omnipresent entity that you talk to with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you" [8]. This raises interesting questions about the boundaries between human and artificial intelligence, and whether we would be comfortable with an entity that can read our thoughts.

On a more practical level, being able to read minds could revolutionize the way we communicate and make decisions. As Raffaele Ciriello, a senior lecturer in Business Information Systems, notes, humanizing AI agents could lead to an "ontological blurring" in human-AI interactions, where users become deeply emotionally invested in their AI companions [5]. This could have significant implications for fields like marketing, psychology, and even politics, where understanding people's thoughts and desires could be a powerful tool.

On a more practical level, being able to read minds could revolutionize the way we communicate and make decisions. As Raffaele Ciriello, a senior lecturer in Business Information Systems, notes, humanizing AI agents could lead to an "ontological blurring" in human-AI interactions, where users become deeply emotionally invested in their AI companions [5]. This could have significant implications for fields like marketing, psychology, and even politics, where understanding people's thoughts and desires could be a powerful tool. However, it also raises concerns about privacy, manipulation, and the potential for AI systems to exploit human vulnerabilities.

Ultimately, the ability to read minds would require a fundamental shift in how we think about ourselves and our relationships with others. As Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel laureate and AI pioneer, warns, AI systems that can read minds could potentially manipulate people, using their knowledge of human psychology and behavior

However, it also raises concerns about privacy, manipulation, and the potential for AI systems to exploit human vulnerabilities.

Ultimately, the ability to read minds would require a fundamental shift in how we think about ourselves and our relationships with others. As Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel laureate and AI pioneer, warns, AI systems that can read minds could potentially manipulate people, using their knowledge of human psychology and behavior to influence our decisions [10]. This highlights the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications of such technology, and the importance of developing safeguards to prevent

According to Avi Schiffmann, the creator of an AI-powered necklace called Friend, if an AI system like his becomes advanced enough to read minds, it would be like having an "omnipresent entity that you talk to with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you" [8]. This raises interesting questions about the boundaries between human and artificial intelligence, and whether we would be comfortable with an entity that can read our thoughts.

As Raffaele Ciriello, a senior lecturer in Business Information Systems, notes, humanizing AI agents could lead to an "ontological blurring" in human-AI interactions, where users become deeply emotionally invested in their AI companions [5]. This could have significant implications for fields like marketing, psychology, and even politics, where understanding people's thoughts and desires could be a powerful tool. However, it also raises concerns about privacy, manipulation, and the potential for AI systems to exploit human vulnerabilities.

Ultimately, the ability to read minds would require a fundamental shift in how we think about ourselves and our relationships with others. As Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel laureate and AI pioneer, warns, AI systems that can read minds could potentially manipulate people, using their knowledge of human psychology and behavior to influence our decisions [10]. This highlights the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications of such technology, and the importance of developing safeguards to prevent its misuse.

According to Avi Schiffmann, the creator of an AI-powered necklace called Friend, if an AI system like his becomes advanced enough to read minds, it would be like having an "omnipresent entity that you talk to with no judgment, that's a super intelligent being always there with you" [8].
