Almost certainly, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress will become the first black President of his country after the first truly universal elections are held next spring. On the eve of his visit to the U.S. to receive the Liberty Medal, Mandela was vigorous and erect despite having spent 27 of his 74 years in South African prisons. He talked in Johannesburg with FORTUNE managing editor Marshall Loeb about the future he foresees for South Africa's economy and the important role foreign business will play.

Full- scale trade and investment will soon resume, as Nelson Mandela calls for an end to all sanctions. Almost certainly, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress will become the first black President of his country after the first truly universal elections are held next spring. On the eve of his visit to the U.S. to receive the Liberty Medal, Mandela was vigorous and erect despite having spent 27 of his 74 years in South African prisons. He talked in Johannesburg with FORTUNE managing editor Marshall Loeb about the future he foresees for South Africa's economy and the important role foreign business will play.

Interview by Marshall Loeb; reporter associate Jane Furth July 12, 1993. A NEW ERA IS DAWNING in relations between the U.S. and South Africa. Full- scale trade and investment will soon resume, as Nelson Mandela calls for an end to all sanctions. Almost certainly, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress will become the first black President of his country after the first truly universal elections are held next spring. On the eve of his visit to the U.S. to receive the Liberty Medal, Mandela was vigorous and erect despite having spent 27 of his 74 years in South African prisons. He talked in Johannesburg with FORTUNE managing editor Marshall Loeb about the future he foresees for South Africa\'s economy and the important role foreign business will play. Excerpts: Q: What are your plans for the economy, and what kinds of foreign companies would you like to see come into or expand in the new South Africa?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nThat is something I have gone out of my way to achieve. I have issued an express invitation to American businessmen to come and invest in our country. So that headline would be accurate. We have said that as soon as a transitional executive council is installed and as soon as a date of election has been fixed, then all financial sanctions should be lifted. We have already agreed on naming a transitional executive council and have set a tentative date for elections -- April 27, 1994. Once that date is confirmed, we will make a call to lift sanctions. There are about 160 U.S. states, counties, and cities that have restrictions on dealing with South Africa. How will you appeal to them? We have already started a drive to get states and communities that have legislation to consider repealing it. Once the date is firm, we will go full steam ahead and urge them to lift those bans. Should FORTUNE 500 companies start getting ready to invest in South Africa?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nWe would hope that they will unbundle on their own. Although state intervention is something that is known throughout the world, we would like to avoid it except where it is absolutely necessary. Some form of intervention may be needed. For example, you have 85% of the population owning only 13% of the land, and a minority of 15% owning 87%. That is something that must be rectified, and state action may be necessary. We could do it without nationalization, without depriving individual owners of their land. There are vast tracts of barren land owned by the SADF ((South African Defense Forces)). That is absolutely unnecessary. We will be forming a democratic government that is committed to peace. We don\'t need a large army or vast pieces of land. That land can then be made available for individual ownership by people who have been denied that opportunity. It can also be used to address the claims of people who were removed by force and to ensure that there is equitable distribution of land in the country. What other steps can you take?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nA: We should look into two areas: the development of a manufacturing base and the development of an infrastructure in the country. Our economy has underperformed since 1975. Growth has been less than the growth of the population. Naturally we require foreign investment. I would not restrict it to any particular kind of company. What we are primarily interested in is development that creates opportunities for employment, because 48% of our people are unemployed. And we are therefore very keen for foreign companies to invest in such a way that there will be a creation of jobs for our people, a generation of wealth. All foreign companies that invest would be guaranteed against expropriation and nationalization. They will be able to recover their profits and dividends -- all of them. We are guaranteeing every foreign company that invests in our country. Would it be fair and accurate to have a headline in FORTUNE read: MANDELA WELCOMES FOREIGN INVESTMENT?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nWe believe in a mixed economy, which is based on private enterprise and which would allow intervention by the state where it is suitable -- where it is in the interest of the country and its people. In the past you have been called a socialist. Now you seem to be moving to the center. Can you describe your position today?  I am neither a capitalist nor a socialist. I am a pragmatist. All that I want is that the living standards of our people be raised. Any strategy that will achieve that objective, I would support.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 2:\nThe African National Congress <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-anc-decline-cf154312e3dc5c1b5ee615b82ba0c080> party lost its parliamentary majority in a historic election result Saturday that puts South Africa on a new political path for the first time since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule 30 years ago.\n\nWith more than 99% of votes counted, the once-dominant ANC <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-elections-voter-guide-6876f39a9c14a61c8f94f123cb66d4ce> had received just over 40% in Wednesday\'s election, well short of the majority it had held since the famed all-race vote of 1994 that ended apartheid and brought it to power <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-apartheid-freedom-democracy-election-d9269650c2d2c813e9794fda145ef22d> under Nelson Mandela.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nPeople lined up deep into the cold winter night on election day and hours after the official poll closing time, with some votes being cast at 3 a.m. the following day. That indicated the desire from many to have their say, but also reflected one of South Africa\'s inherent problems <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-power-cuts-electricity-corruption-c86b3db8bce962cd8b0fa672310d95aa> — some voting stations had delays because of electricity outages plunging them into the dark.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nThe official unemployment rate is 32% and the poverty disproportionately affects Black people, who make up 80% of the population and have been the core of the ANC\'s support for years. The violent crime rate is also appallingly high.\n\nThe ANC has also been blamed — and now punished by voters — for a failure in basic government services that impacts millions <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-poverty-anc-vote-c9ce37716f1e31cf305361c4469a58e9> of poor, and leaves many without water, electricity or proper housing. More recently, a national electricity crisis that led to nationwide power blackouts angered South Africans across the board.\n\nThe ANC has seen a steady decline in its support over the last 20 years, but by around three to five percentage points each election. It dropped 17 percentage points this time from the 57.5% it won in 2019, a staggering outcome in the context of the country.\n\nNearly 28 million South Africans were registered to vote, and turnout was expected to be around 60%, according to the electoral commission.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nThe way forward threatens to be complicated for Africa’s most advanced economy <https://apnews.com/hub/south-africa>, and there’s no coalition on the table yet. The three main opposition parties and many more smaller ones were in the mix as the bargaining begins.\n\n“We can talk to anybody and everybody,” ANC Chairman Gwede Mantashe said on national broadcaster SABC.\n\nSteenhuisen\'s Democratic Alliance was on around 21% of the vote. The new MK Party <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-zuma-anc-mk-6b18554612c5f6ff636f84352cbecdd5> of former President Jacob Zuma, who has turned against the ANC he once led, was third with just over 14% of the vote in the first election it has contested. The Economic Freedom Fighters was fourth with just over 9%.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nThe final results are still to be formally declared by the Independent Electoral Commission, but the ANC cannot pass 50% and an era of coalition government — also a first for South Africa — is looming.\n\nThe electoral commission said it would formally declare the results on Sunday.\n\nWhile opposition parties hailed the outcome as a momentous breakthrough for a country struggling with deep poverty and inequality, the ANC remained the biggest party by some way.\n\nHowever, the unprecedented slump in its support means it will now likely need to look for a coalition partner or partners to remain in the government and reelect President Cyril Ramaphosa for a second and final term. Parliament must meet to elect the South African president within 14 days after the election result is declared.\n\n“The way to rescue South Africa is to break the ANC’s majority and we have done that,” said John Steenhuisen, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Alliance party.\n\nJulius Malema, the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters opposition party, said that the ANC\'s “entitlement of being the sole dominant party” was over.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nMore than 50 parties <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-ramaphosa-anc-parties-44187959a44ddaddadd0ad4b23bebd83> contested the election, many of them winning tiny shares, but the three main opposition parties appear to be the most obvious for the ANC to approach <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-vote-explainer-anc-ramaphosa-0e7600dc16bd51e3b6faa6cef6455e24>.\n\nElectoral commission Chairman Mosotho Moepya said it was a time for everyone to keep calm “and for leaders to lead and for voices of reason to continue to prevail.”\n\n"This is a moment we need to manage and manage well," he said.\n\nSteenhuisen said his party is open to discussions with the ANC, as did Malema. The MK Party said one of their conditions for any agreement was that Ramaphosa is removed as ANC leader and president. That underlined the fierce personal political battle between Zuma, who resigned as South African president under a cloud of corruption allegations in 2018, and Ramaphosa, who replaced him.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nDA says an ANC-MK-EFF agreement would be a “doomsday coalition” given MK and EFF are made up of former ANC figures and would pursue the same failed policies.\n\nThe three opposition parties had a combined share that was bigger than the ANC, but they are highly unlikely to all work together. The DA was also part of a preelection agreement with other smaller parties to potentially form a coalition.\n\nAmid it all, there was no sense of celebrations from ordinary South Africans, but rather the realization that a rocky political road was ahead. The Daily Maverick newspaper had a South African scratching his head with the words: “What Does It Mean For Our Future?” on its front page. The Die Burger newspaper led with an image of about a dozen political parties\' logos going into a meat grinder.\n\nSouth African opposition parties <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-opposition-7993a72a56538198592235b6f957b750> were united in one thing — something had to change in the country of 62 million, which is Africa\'s most developed but also one of the most unequal in the world.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/'}

Interview by Marshall Loeb; reporter associate Jane Furth July 12, 1993. A NEW ERA IS DAWNING in relations between the U.S. and South Africa. Full- scale trade and investment will soon resume, as Nelson Mandela calls for an end to all sanctions. Almost certainly, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress will become the first black President of his country after the first truly universal elections are held next spring. On the eve of his visit to the U.S. to receive the Liberty Medal, Mandela was vigorous and erect despite having spent 27 of his 74 years in South African prisons. He talked in Johannesburg with FORTUNE managing editor Marshall Loeb about the future he foresees for South Africa\'s economy and the important role foreign business will play.

I have issued an express invitation to American businessmen to come and invest in our country. So that headline would be accurate. We have said that as soon as a transitional executive council is installed and as soon as a date of election has been fixed, then all financial sanctions should be lifted. We have already agreed on naming a transitional executive council and have set a tentative date for elections -- April 27, 1994. Once that date is confirmed, we will make a call to lift sanctions. There are about 160 U.S. states, counties, and cities that have restrictions on dealing with South Africa. How will you appeal to them? We have already started a drive to get states and communities that have legislation to consider repealing it. Once the date is firm, we will go full steam ahead and urge them to lift those bans.

Although state intervention is something that is known throughout the world, we would like to avoid it except where it is absolutely necessary. Some form of intervention may be needed. For example, you have 85% of the population owning only 13% of the land, and a minority of 15% owning 87%. That is something that must be rectified, and state action may be necessary. We could do it without nationalization, without depriving individual owners of their land. There are vast tracts of barren land owned by the SADF ((South African Defense Forces)). That is absolutely unnecessary. We will be forming a democratic government that is committed to peace. We don\'t need a large army or vast pieces of land. That land can then be made available for individual ownership by people who have been denied that opportunity. It can also be used to address the claims of people who were removed by force and to ensure that there is equitable distribution of land in the country. What other steps can you take?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nA: We should look into two areas: the development of a manufacturing base and the development of an infrastructure in the country. Our economy has underperformed since 1975. Growth has been less than the growth of the population. Naturally we require foreign investment. I would not restrict it to any particular kind of company. What we are primarily interested in is development that creates opportunities for employment, because 48% of our people are unemployed. And we are therefore very keen for foreign companies to invest in such a way that there will be a creation of jobs for our people, a generation of wealth. All foreign companies that invest would be guaranteed against expropriation and nationalization. They will be able to recover their profits and dividends -- all of them. We are guaranteeing every foreign company that invests in our country.

Interview by Marshall Loeb; reporter associate Jane Furth July 12, 1993. A NEW ERA IS DAWNING in relations between the U.S. and South Africa. Full- scale trade and investment will soon resume, as Nelson Mandela calls for an end to all sanctions. Almost certainly, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress will become the first black President of his country after the first truly universal elections are held next spring. On the eve of his visit to the U.S. to receive the Liberty Medal, Mandela was vigorous and erect despite having spent 27 of his 74 years in South African prisons. He talked in Johannesburg with FORTUNE managing editor Marshall Loeb about the future he foresees for South Africa\'s economy and the important role foreign business will play. Excerpts: Q: What are your plans for the economy, and what kinds of foreign companies would you like to see come into or expand in the new South Africa?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nThat is something I have gone out of my way to achieve. I have issued an express invitation to American businessmen to come and invest in our country. So that headline would be accurate. We have said that as soon as a transitional executive council is installed and as soon as a date of election has been fixed, then all financial sanctions should be lifted. We have already agreed on naming a transitional executive council and have set a tentative date for elections -- April 27, 1994. Once that date is confirmed, we will make a call to lift sanctions. There are about 160 U.S. states, counties, and cities that have restrictions on dealing with South Africa. How will you appeal to them? We have already started a drive to get states and communities that have legislation to consider repealing it. Once the date is firm, we will go full steam ahead and urge them to lift those bans. Should FORTUNE 500 companies start getting ready to invest in South Africa?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nWe would hope that they will unbundle on their own. Although state intervention is something that is known throughout the world, we would like to avoid it except where it is absolutely necessary. Some form of intervention may be needed. For example, you have 85% of the population owning only 13% of the land, and a minority of 15% owning 87%. That is something that must be rectified, and state action may be necessary. We could do it without nationalization, without depriving individual owners of their land. There are vast tracts of barren land owned by the SADF ((South African Defense Forces)). That is absolutely unnecessary. We will be forming a democratic government that is committed to peace. We don\'t need a large army or vast pieces of land. That land can then be made available for individual ownership by people who have been denied that opportunity. It can also be used to address the claims of people who were removed by force and to ensure that there is equitable distribution of land in the country. What other steps can you take?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nA: We should look into two areas: the development of a manufacturing base and the development of an infrastructure in the country. Our economy has underperformed since 1975. Growth has been less than the growth of the population. Naturally we require foreign investment. I would not restrict it to any particular kind of company. What we are primarily interested in is development that creates opportunities for employment, because 48% of our people are unemployed. And we are therefore very keen for foreign companies to invest in such a way that there will be a creation of jobs for our people, a generation of wealth. All foreign companies that invest would be guaranteed against expropriation and nationalization. They will be able to recover their profits and dividends -- all of them. We are guaranteeing every foreign company that invests in our country. Would it be fair and accurate to have a headline in FORTUNE read: MANDELA WELCOMES FOREIGN INVESTMENT?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nWe believe in a mixed economy, which is based on private enterprise and which would allow intervention by the state where it is suitable -- where it is in the interest of the country and its people. In the past you have been called a socialist. Now you seem to be moving to the center. Can you describe your position today?  I am neither a capitalist nor a socialist. I am a pragmatist. All that I want is that the living standards of our people be raised. Any strategy that will achieve that objective, I would support.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 2:\nThe African National Congress <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-anc-decline-cf154312e3dc5c1b5ee615b82ba0c080> party lost its parliamentary majority in a historic election result Saturday that puts South Africa on a new political path for the first time since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule 30 years ago.\n\nWith more than 99% of votes counted, the once-dominant ANC <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-elections-voter-guide-6876f39a9c14a61c8f94f123cb66d4ce> had received just over 40% in Wednesday\'s election, well short of the majority it had held since the famed all-race vote of 1994 that ended apartheid and brought it to power <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-apartheid-freedom-democracy-election-d9269650c2d2c813e9794fda145ef22d> under Nelson Mandela.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nPeople lined up deep into the cold winter night on election day and hours after the official poll closing time, with some votes being cast at 3 a.m. the following day. That indicated the desire from many to have their say, but also reflected one of South Africa\'s inherent problems <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-power-cuts-electricity-corruption-c86b3db8bce962cd8b0fa672310d95aa> — some voting stations had delays because of electricity outages plunging them into the dark.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nThe official unemployment rate is 32% and the poverty disproportionately affects Black people, who make up 80% of the population and have been the core of the ANC\'s support for years. The violent crime rate is also appallingly high.\n\nThe ANC has also been blamed — and now punished by voters — for a failure in basic government services that impacts millions <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-poverty-anc-vote-c9ce37716f1e31cf305361c4469a58e9> of poor, and leaves many without water, electricity or proper housing. More recently, a national electricity crisis that led to nationwide power blackouts angered South Africans across the board.\n\nThe ANC has seen a steady decline in its support over the last 20 years, but by around three to five percentage points each election. It dropped 17 percentage points this time from the 57.5% it won in 2019, a staggering outcome in the context of the country.\n\nNearly 28 million South Africans were registered to vote, and turnout was expected to be around 60%, according to the electoral commission.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nThe way forward threatens to be complicated for Africa’s most advanced economy <https://apnews.com/hub/south-africa>, and there’s no coalition on the table yet. The three main opposition parties and many more smaller ones were in the mix as the bargaining begins.\n\n“We can talk to anybody and everybody,” ANC Chairman Gwede Mantashe said on national broadcaster SABC.\n\nSteenhuisen\'s Democratic Alliance was on around 21% of the vote. The new MK Party <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-zuma-anc-mk-6b18554612c5f6ff636f84352cbecdd5> of former President Jacob Zuma, who has turned against the ANC he once led, was third with just over 14% of the vote in the first election it has contested. The Economic Freedom Fighters was fourth with just over 9%.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nThe final results are still to be formally declared by the Independent Electoral Commission, but the ANC cannot pass 50% and an era of coalition government — also a first for South Africa — is looming.\n\nThe electoral commission said it would formally declare the results on Sunday.\n\nWhile opposition parties hailed the outcome as a momentous breakthrough for a country struggling with deep poverty and inequality, the ANC remained the biggest party by some way.\n\nHowever, the unprecedented slump in its support means it will now likely need to look for a coalition partner or partners to remain in the government and reelect President Cyril Ramaphosa for a second and final term. Parliament must meet to elect the South African president within 14 days after the election result is declared.\n\n“The way to rescue South Africa is to break the ANC’s majority and we have done that,” said John Steenhuisen, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Alliance party.\n\nJulius Malema, the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters opposition party, said that the ANC\'s “entitlement of being the sole dominant party” was over.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nMore than 50 parties <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-ramaphosa-anc-parties-44187959a44ddaddadd0ad4b23bebd83> contested the election, many of them winning tiny shares, but the three main opposition parties appear to be the most obvious for the ANC to approach <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-vote-explainer-anc-ramaphosa-0e7600dc16bd51e3b6faa6cef6455e24>.\n\nElectoral commission Chairman Mosotho Moepya said it was a time for everyone to keep calm “and for leaders to lead and for voices of reason to continue to prevail.”\n\n"This is a moment we need to manage and manage well," he said.\n\nSteenhuisen said his party is open to discussions with the ANC, as did Malema. The MK Party said one of their conditions for any agreement was that Ramaphosa is removed as ANC leader and president. That underlined the fierce personal political battle between Zuma, who resigned as South African president under a cloud of corruption allegations in 2018, and Ramaphosa, who replaced him.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nDA says an ANC-MK-EFF agreement would be a “doomsday coalition” given MK and EFF are made up of former ANC figures and would pursue the same failed policies.\n\nThe three opposition parties had a combined share that was bigger than the ANC, but they are highly unlikely to all work together. The DA was also part of a preelection agreement with other smaller parties to potentially form a coalition.\n\nAmid it all, there was no sense of celebrations from ordinary South Africans, but rather the realization that a rocky political road was ahead. The Daily Maverick newspaper had a South African scratching his head with the words: “What Does It Mean For Our Future?” on its front page.
