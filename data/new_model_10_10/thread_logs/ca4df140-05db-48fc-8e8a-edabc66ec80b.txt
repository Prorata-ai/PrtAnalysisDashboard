"See how understated that is?" he said in a rare outburst of irony. A foreign-sounding woman on the street recognized him. "Are you going to be a President?" she asked. "Absolutely," said Trump. "No doubt about it." Three weeks later (after Fortune had flown with him to St. Louis for some final politicking and, yes, a Tony Robbins speech) Trump announced he wasn\'t running. The proximate cause was the Reform Party meeting that ended with red-faced delegates screaming and jostling one another for microphones, and Jesse Ventura\'s subsequent secession from the "dysfunctional" party.

"See how understated that is?" he said in a rare outburst of irony. A foreign-sounding woman on the street recognized him. "Are you going to be a President?" she asked. "Absolutely," said Trump. "No doubt about it." Three weeks later (after Fortune had flown with him to St. Louis for some final politicking and, yes, a Tony Robbins speech) Trump announced he wasn\'t running. The proximate cause was the Reform Party meeting that ended with red-faced delegates screaming and jostling one another for microphones, and Jesse Ventura\'s subsequent secession from the "dysfunctional" party. Privately, I wondered if Trump had begun to doubt his own constitutional capability for certain political rituals, notably the concession speech. But the final nail in the coffin was John McCain\'s surprise surge in the polls. Roger Stone felt robbed: "He\'s running on Trump\'s message."

Vance — “like jay-dot-dee-dot,” he wrote, short for James David. In the book, he explained that this was not the first iteration of his name. Nor would it be the last.\n\nOver the course of his 39 years, Vance\'s first, middle and last names have all been altered in one way or another. Since Vance was first introduced to the country as Donald Trump’s running mate, his name has been the source of both curiosity and questions — including why he no longer uses periods in JD.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-is-jd-vance-real-name-origin-john-david-hamel/\n\nSource 1:\nAsked by The Associated Press at the time if this was a formal change, or merely stylistic, his campaign said it was how Vance preferred to be referred to in print. He has maintained the usage as a U.S. senator, referring to himself as JD Vance on his Senate website, in press releases and in certain campaign and business filings.\n\nThe nominee\'s legal name today is James David Vance. The AP, whose industry-standard AP Stylebook advises to generally call people by the name they prefer, honors his request to go by JD with no periods.\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on July 26, 2024. \n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/article/what-is-jd-vance-real-name-origin-john-david-hamel/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-is-jd-vance-real-name-origin-john-david-hamel/\n\nSource 1:\nBut the situation gnawed at him, particularly after his mother and adoptive father divorced.\n\n“I shared a name with no one I really cared about (which bothered me already), and with Bob gone, explaining why my name was J.D. Hamel would require a few additional awkward moments,” he writes in “Hillbilly Elegy.” “Yeah, my legal father\'s last name is Hamel. You haven\'t met him because I don\'t see him. No, I don\'t know why I don\'t see him. Of all the things that I hated about my childhood, nothing compared to the revolving door of father figures.”\n\nSo he decided to change his name again, to Vance — the last name of his beloved Mamaw, the grandmother who raised him.\n\nIt didn\'t happen on his wedding day in 2014, as the book implies, but in April 2013, as he was about to graduate from Yale, Van Kirk said. It felt right to take the name of the woman who raised him before dying in 2005, as he was putting the struggles of his early life behind him and launching into this new phase.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-is-jd-vance-real-name-origin-john-david-hamel/\n\nSource 1:\nVance <https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/jd-vance-political-federal-reserve-powell/> spent more than two decades as James David “J.D.” Hamel. It\'s the name by which he graduated from Middletown High School, served in Iraq as a U.S. Marine (officially, Cpl. James D. Hamel), earned a political science degree at The Ohio State University and blogged his ruminations as a 26-year-old student at Yale Law School. Those facts are borne out in documentation provided by those entities upon request, or otherwise publicly available, and were confirmed by campaign spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk.\n\nBut the situation gnawed at him, particularly after his mother and adoptive father divorced.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-is-jd-vance-real-name-origin-john-david-hamel/\n\nSource 1:\n“Throughout his tumultuous childhood, Mamaw — or Bonnie Blanton Vance — raised JD and was always his north star,” Van Kirk said in a statement. “It only felt right to him to take Vance as his last name.”\n\nClaiming the Vance name also served to tie JD more clearly to what he writes was “hillbilly royalty” on his grandfather\'s side not long before he would release a book opining on hillbilly culture. A distant cousin to his Papaw, also named James Vance, married into the McCoy-hating Hatfield family and committed a murder that “kicked off one of the most famous family feuds in American history,” Vance wrote in his book.\n\nVance achieved a clean slate of sorts with his new name, just as he was entering his career as a lawyer and author. Besides being the name on his book, it\'s the name he used to register for the bar, to marry, to enter the world of venture capital in the Silicon Valley and as he became a father.\n\nBut there was one more name alteration to come.\n\nWhen Vance jumped into politics in July 2021, he had removed the periods from J.D. He\'d often used this shorthand, JD, over his lifetime.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-is-jd-vance-real-name-origin-john-david-hamel/\n\nSource 2:\nIf asked whether he is a socialist, he replies, like a good 90 per cent of French workers, "Of course." But he adds quickly, "Minute, papillon" -- a phrase that could be roughly (and inadequately) translated as "Just a minute, bud." For theword "socialist" in Europe can easily lead to misunderstanding. He wants you to understand that it means he\'s for socialism, and fears you\'ll take it to mean that he supports the official French socialist party (S.F.I.O.), whose leadership, he thinks, has no interest whatsoever in real socialism. In fact, like the vast majority of French workers in the present conjuncture, he doesn\'t see any immediate way out-let alone any clear way to socialism. If he could see such a way, his instinctive class consciousness and temperamental militancy would, as his record shows, make him a tough fighter. But as things are, he tends to draw in on himself and say, with a deprecatory smile, "Pour le moment, vous savez, ma politique-c\'est mon vélo" that is,"For the moment, you know, my politics -- that\'s my bike." Besides, he points out, politics isn\'t just\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/french-worker-fortune-1948/\n\nSource 3:\nWilliam Shakespeare famously dismissed the importance of names.

"See how understated that is?" he said in a rare outburst of irony. A foreign-sounding woman on the street recognized him. "Are you going to be a President?" she asked. "Absolutely," said Trump. "No doubt about it." Three weeks later (after Fortune had flown with him to St. Louis for some final politicking and, yes, a Tony Robbins speech) Trump announced he wasn\'t running. The proximate cause was the Reform Party meeting that ended with red-faced delegates screaming and jostling one another for microphones, and Jesse Ventura\'s subsequent secession from the "dysfunctional" party. Privately, I wondered if Trump had begun to doubt his own constitutional capability for certain political rituals, notably the concession speech. But the final nail in the coffin was John McCain\'s surprise surge in the polls. Roger Stone felt robbed: "He\'s running on Trump\'s message." As I was finishing up the story, Trump called me nearly every day, unsolicited, to offer tidbits of information, including details of the "very successful" tennis tournament he\'d hosted\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-does-donald-trump-really-want/\n\nSource 4:\nperhaps wasn\'t so much egotistical as medical. I even called a psychiatrist to get his clinical assessment of Trump. (He suggested an overmastering need to escape the shadow of his father, Fred, a successful outer-borough developer who died last year and whom Trump rarely mentions.) But the real puzzler is what, exactly, Donald Trump wants. As we walked through the half-gutted lobby of the General Motors <https://fortune.com/company/general-motors/> Building, Trump insisted he most wanted to be respected as a builder. "The thing I do best is I build," he said. "Everyone says, \'Oh, Trump is a great promoter.\' I don\'t think I\'m even a good promoter. You build a great product, it becomes successful." He paused to touch some tiny bronze fixtures. "See, these were all corroded—they looked disgusting," he said. "Now it\'s great, right?" But even while Trump complains he\'d like to be covered "more in business and less in social," he can\'t seem to help himself. In the end, one is simply humbled before the awesome insularity of his logic. "I own a lot of things that I don\'t have my name on," he explained at one\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-does-donald-trump-really-want/\n\nSource 5:\nnobody would ever have heard his name.

Vance — “like jay-dot-dee-dot,” he wrote, short for James David. In the book, he explained that this was not the first iteration of his name. Nor would it be the last.\n\nOver the course of his 39 years, Vance\'s first, middle and last names have all been altered in one way or another. Since Vance was first introduced to the country as Donald Trump’s running mate, his name has been the source of both curiosity and questions — including why he no longer uses periods in JD.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-is-jd-vance-real-name-origin-john-david-hamel/\n\nSource 1:\nAsked by The Associated Press at the time if this was a formal change, or merely stylistic, his campaign said it was how Vance preferred to be referred to in print. He has maintained the usage as a U.S. senator, referring to himself as JD Vance on his Senate website, in press releases and in certain campaign and business filings.\n\nThe nominee\'s legal name today is James David Vance. The AP, whose industry-standard AP Stylebook advises to generally call people by the name they prefer, honors his request to go by JD with no periods.\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on July 26, 2024. \n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/article/what-is-jd-vance-real-name-origin-john-david-hamel/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-is-jd-vance-real-name-origin-john-david-hamel/\n\nSource 1:\nBut the situation gnawed at him, particularly after his mother and adoptive father divorced.\n\n“I shared a name with no one I really cared about (which bothered me already), and with Bob gone, explaining why my name was J.D. Hamel would require a few additional awkward moments,” he writes in “Hillbilly Elegy.” “Yeah, my legal father\'s last name is Hamel. You haven\'t met him because I don\'t see him. No, I don\'t know why I don\'t see him. Of all the things that I hated about my childhood, nothing compared to the revolving door of father figures.”\n\nSo he decided to change his name again, to Vance — the last name of his beloved Mamaw, the grandmother who raised him.\n\nIt didn\'t happen on his wedding day in 2014, as the book implies, but in April 2013, as he was about to graduate from Yale, Van Kirk said. It felt right to take the name of the woman who raised him before dying in 2005, as he was putting the struggles of his early life behind him and launching into this new phase.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-is-jd-vance-real-name-origin-john-david-hamel/\n\nSource 1:\nVance <https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/jd-vance-political-federal-reserve-powell/> spent more than two decades as James David “J.D.” Hamel. It\'s the name by which he graduated from Middletown High School, served in Iraq as a U.S. Marine (officially, Cpl. James D. Hamel), earned a political science degree at The Ohio State University and blogged his ruminations as a 26-year-old student at Yale Law School. Those facts are borne out in documentation provided by those entities upon request, or otherwise publicly available, and were confirmed by campaign spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk.\n\nBut the situation gnawed at him, particularly after his mother and adoptive father divorced.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-is-jd-vance-real-name-origin-john-david-hamel/\n\nSource 1:\n“Throughout his tumultuous childhood, Mamaw — or Bonnie Blanton Vance — raised JD and was always his north star,” Van Kirk said in a statement. “It only felt right to him to take Vance as his last name.”\n\nClaiming the Vance name also served to tie JD more clearly to what he writes was “hillbilly royalty” on his grandfather\'s side not long before he would release a book opining on hillbilly culture. A distant cousin to his Papaw, also named James Vance, married into the McCoy-hating Hatfield family and committed a murder that “kicked off one of the most famous family feuds in American history,” Vance wrote in his book.\n\nVance achieved a clean slate of sorts with his new name, just as he was entering his career as a lawyer and author. Besides being the name on his book, it\'s the name he used to register for the bar, to marry, to enter the world of venture capital in the Silicon Valley and as he became a father.\n\nBut there was one more name alteration to come.\n\nWhen Vance jumped into politics in July 2021, he had removed the periods from J.D. He\'d often used this shorthand, JD, over his lifetime.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-is-jd-vance-real-name-origin-john-david-hamel/\n\nSource 2:\nIf asked whether he is a socialist, he replies, like a good 90 per cent of French workers, "Of course." But he adds quickly, "Minute, papillon" -- a phrase that could be roughly (and inadequately) translated as "Just a minute, bud." For theword "socialist" in Europe can easily lead to misunderstanding. He wants you to understand that it means he\'s for socialism, and fears you\'ll take it to mean that he supports the official French socialist party (S.F.I.O.), whose leadership, he thinks, has no interest whatsoever in real socialism. In fact, like the vast majority of French workers in the present conjuncture, he doesn\'t see any immediate way out-let alone any clear way to socialism. If he could see such a way, his instinctive class consciousness and temperamental militancy would, as his record shows, make him a tough fighter. But as things are, he tends to draw in on himself and say, with a deprecatory smile, "Pour le moment, vous savez, ma politique-c\'est mon vélo" that is,"For the moment, you know, my politics -- that\'s my bike." Besides, he points out, politics isn\'t just\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/french-worker-fortune-1948/\n\nSource 3:\nWilliam Shakespeare famously dismissed the importance of names.

"But when I don\'t put my name on it, nobody knows that I own it. That\'s one of the reasons I like putting my name on things."\nOutside the General Motors Building, Trump and I paused by his limo for a few seconds to stare up at the huge trump lettering on the facade. "See how understated that is?" he said in a rare outburst of irony. A foreign-sounding woman on the street recognized him. "Are you going to be a President?" she asked. "Absolutely," said Trump. "No doubt about it." Three weeks later (after Fortune had flown with him to St. Louis for some final politicking and, yes, a Tony Robbins speech) Trump announced he wasn\'t running. The proximate cause was the Reform Party meeting that ended with red-faced delegates screaming and jostling one another for microphones, and Jesse Ventura\'s subsequent secession from the "dysfunctional" party. Privately, I wondered if Trump had begun to doubt his own constitutional capability for certain political rituals, notably the concession speech. But the final nail in the coffin was John McCain\'s surprise surge in the polls. Roger Stone felt robbed: "He\'s running on Trump\'s message." As I was finishing up the story, Trump called me nearly every day, unsolicited, to offer tidbits of information, including details of the "very successful" tennis tournament he\'d hosted\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-does-donald-trump-really-want/\n\nSource 4:\nperhaps wasn\'t so much egotistical as medical. I even called a psychiatrist to get his clinical assessment of Trump. (He suggested an overmastering need to escape the shadow of his father, Fred, a successful outer-borough developer who died last year and whom Trump rarely mentions.) But the real puzzler is what, exactly, Donald Trump wants. As we walked through the half-gutted lobby of the General Motors <https://fortune.com/company/general-motors/> Building, Trump insisted he most wanted to be respected as a builder. "The thing I do best is I build," he said. "Everyone says, \'Oh, Trump is a great promoter.\' I don\'t think I\'m even a good promoter. You build a great product, it becomes successful." He paused to touch some tiny bronze fixtures. "See, these were all corroded—they looked disgusting," he said. "Now it\'s great, right?" But even while Trump complains he\'d like to be covered "more in business and less in social," he can\'t seem to help himself. In the end, one is simply humbled before the awesome insularity of his logic. "I own a lot of things that I don\'t have my name on," he explained at one\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/what-does-donald-trump-really-want/\n\nSource 5:\nnobody would ever have heard his name.

The story of Fuller brushes is primarily a selling story, a story of how to sell. It is also a first-rate study in normal and subnormal psychology; and, whether appalling or inspiring, a fine demonstration of one modern way to make a practical, profitable use of the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-ups-and-downs-of-the-fuller-brush-co-fortune-1938/\n\nSource 6:\nSo, after abbreviating my name professionally for decades, I decided to follow the advice my mother gave me so long ago and reclaim my true name in the workplace.

It\'s not just a bunch of bullshit. We\'re rolling out the chips," he says, eyes widening. Simplot has a growly, rolling, almost theatrical delivery--George C. Scott would do well as a movie version--that tends to rise in a crescendo at the end of sentences. It could be a radio voice, which isn\'t surprising, since one of his best friends was the late broadcaster Lowell Thomas, whom he met years ago at Averell Harriman\'s cottage at Sun Valley. Simplot stretches his solid 5-foot 10-inch frame and pulls out a little wallet-size display of Micron\'s chips. "On this little chip we can get 16 million bits of information.
