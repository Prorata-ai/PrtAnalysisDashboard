Indeed, one in three American households are cutting back on groceries to help pay for their utility bills as 75% of them expect their expenses to increase during the summer and “cause them financial strain.” The figures are according to survey results of 2,000 U.S. adults by PowerSetter <https://www.powersetter.com/about-us/>, an energy comparison platform that educates consumers about different energy plans and options. For context, July 22 was the hottest day recorded on earth <https://fortune.com/2024/07/24/monday-july-22-hottest-day-recorded-on-earth/>, according to satellite data <https://pulse.climate.copernicus.eu/>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/why-air-conditioning-bills-so-expensive/\n\nSource 8:\n“Weather is becoming more volatile and extreme,” Andrew Meyer, CEO of home energy advisory Arbor <https://www.joinarbor.com/> that helps consumers find lower energy rates, tells Fortune. “When it’s hotter, we use more electricity to cool our homes. When it’s cold, we use more gas to heat our homes.”\n\nBut while global warming and climate change “certainly play a part in how high energy bills have gotten, but it’s not necessarily just in the way you might think,” Meyer says. A major problem for electric utilities, however, has been increasing demand is also causing energy prices to rise.\n\n“Consumers are both using more and paying more per unit of energy,” Meyer explains. Energy units are measured in kilowatt-hours (kwh), and can have a “huge impact on our bill totals at the end of the month,” Meyer adds.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/why-air-conditioning-bills-so-expensive/\n\nSource 9:\nCopernicus records go back to 1940, but other global measurements by the United States and United Kingdom governments go back even further, to 1880.

Indeed, one in three American households are cutting back on groceries to help pay for their utility bills as 75% of them expect their expenses to increase during the summer and “cause them financial strain.” The figures are according to survey results of 2,000 U.S. adults by PowerSetter <https://www.powersetter.com/about-us/>, an energy comparison platform that educates consumers about different energy plans and options. For context, July 22 was the hottest day recorded on earth <https://fortune.com/2024/07/24/monday-july-22-hottest-day-recorded-on-earth/>, according to satellite data <https://pulse.climate.copernicus.eu/>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/why-air-conditioning-bills-so-expensive/\n\nSource 8:\n“Weather is becoming more volatile and extreme,” Andrew Meyer, CEO of home energy advisory Arbor <https://www.joinarbor.com/> that helps consumers find lower energy rates, tells Fortune. “When it’s hotter, we use more electricity to cool our homes. When it’s cold, we use more gas to heat our homes.”\n\nBut while global warming and climate change “certainly play a part in how high energy bills have gotten, but it’s not necessarily just in the way you might think,” Meyer says. A major problem for electric utilities, however, has been increasing demand is also causing energy prices to rise.\n\n“Consumers are both using more and paying more per unit of energy,” Meyer explains. Energy units are measured in kilowatt-hours (kwh), and can have a “huge impact on our bill totals at the end of the month,” Meyer adds.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/why-air-conditioning-bills-so-expensive/\n\nSource 9:\nCopernicus records go back to 1940, but other global measurements by the United States and United Kingdom governments go back even further, to 1880.

Now the first six months of 2024 have broken even those.\n\nWithout human-caused climate change <https://apnews.com/hub/environment>, scientists say that extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years.\n\nFormer head of U.N. climate negotiations Christiana Figueres said “we all scorch and fry” if the world doesn\'t immediately change course.\n\n“One third of global electricity can be produced by solar and wind alone, but targeted national policies have to enable that transformation,” she said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/24/monday-july-22-hottest-day-recorded-on-earth/'}

2024-11-08 06:51:25,581: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. The main driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [1]. Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture

2024-11-08 06:51:26,149: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. The main driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [1]. Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase. Scientists

2024-11-08 06:51:26,808: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. The main driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [1]. Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase. Scientists say that without human-caused climate change, extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as

2024-11-08 06:51:26,830: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. The main driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [1]. Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase. Scientists say that without human-caused climate change, extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years [9].

2024-11-08 06:51:26,950: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. The main driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [1]. Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase. Scientists say that without human-caused climate change, extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years [9].

2024-11-08 06:51:27,220: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. The main driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [1]. Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase. Scientists say that without human-caused climate change, extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years [9]. The long-term warming trend is directly related to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and it is the main driving force behind record temperatures [3]. In fact, the world was

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase. Scientists say that without human-caused climate change, extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years [9]. The long-term warming trend is directly related to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and it is the main driving force behind record temperatures [3].

2024-11-08 06:51:27,887: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. The main driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [1]. Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase. Scientists say that without human-caused climate change, extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years [9]. The long-term warming trend is directly related to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and it is the main driving force behind record temperatures [3]. In fact, the world was 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer in July than pre-industrial times, according to Copernicus' measurement [3].

2024-11-08 06:51:28,019: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. The main driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [1]. Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase. Scientists say that without human-caused climate change, extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years [9]. The long-term warming trend is directly related to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and it is the main driving force behind record temperatures [3]. In fact, the world was 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer in July than pre-industrial times, according to Copernicus' measurement [3].

The effects of global warming are widespread and varied, including more frequent and severe heat

2024-11-08 06:51:28,310: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. The main driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [1]. Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase. Scientists say that without human-caused climate change, extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years [9]. The long-term warming trend is directly related to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and it is the main driving force behind record temperatures [3]. In fact, the world was 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer in July than pre-industrial times, according to Copernicus' measurement [3].

The effects of global warming are widespread and varied, including more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, and storms [1]. Climate change is also causing rising sea levels, eroding

2024-11-08 06:51:28,581: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. The main driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [1]. Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase. Scientists say that without human-caused climate change, extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years [9]. The long-term warming trend is directly related to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and it is the main driving force behind record temperatures [3]. In fact, the world was 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer in July than pre-industrial times, according to Copernicus' measurement [3].

The effects of global warming are widespread and varied, including more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, and storms [1]. Climate change is also causing rising sea levels, eroding shorelines, and destroying homes [8]. Furthermore, climate change is having a significant impact on the economy

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase. Scientists say that without human-caused climate change, extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years [9]. The long-term warming trend is directly related to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and it is the main driving force behind record temperatures [3]. In fact, the world was 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer in July than pre-industrial times, according to Copernicus' measurement [3].

The effects of global warming are widespread and varied, including more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, and storms [1]. Climate change is also causing rising sea levels, eroding shorelines, and destroying homes [8]. Furthermore, climate change is having a significant impact on the economy, with 75% of American households expecting their expenses to increase during the summer

In fact, the world was 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer in July than pre-industrial times, according to Copernicus' measurement [3].

The effects of global warming are widespread and varied, including more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, and storms [1]. Climate change is also causing rising sea levels, eroding shorelines, and destroying homes [8]. Furthermore, climate change is having a significant impact on the economy, with 75% of American households expecting their expenses to increase during the summer and cause them financial strain [8].

2024-11-08 06:51:29,017: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. The main driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [1]. Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase.

The long-term warming trend is directly related to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and it is the main driving force behind record temperatures [3]. In fact, the world was 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer in July than pre-industrial times, according to Copernicus' measurement [3].

The effects of global warming are widespread and varied, including more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, and storms [1]. Climate change is also causing rising sea levels, eroding shorelines, and destroying homes [8]. Furthermore, climate change is having a significant impact on the economy, with 75% of American households expecting their expenses to increase during the summer and cause them financial strain [8]. It is essential to address the root causes of global warming to mitigate its effects and prevent further warming

2024-11-08 06:51:29,160: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. The main driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [1]. Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].

Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase. Scientists say that without human-caused climate change, extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years [9]. The long-term warming trend is directly related to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and it is the main driving force behind record temperatures [3]. In fact, the world was 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer in July than pre-industrial times, according to Copernicus' measurement [3].

The effects of global warming are widespread and varied, including more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, and storms [1]. Climate change is also causing rising sea levels, eroding shorelines, and destroying homes [8]. Furthermore, climate change is having a significant impact on the economy, with 75% of American households expecting their expenses to increase during the summer and cause them financial strain [8]. It is essential to address the root causes of global warming to mitigate its effects and prevent further warming. As Christiana Figueres, former head of U.N. climate

2024-11-08 06:51:30,258: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. The main driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [1]. Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase. Scientists say that without human-caused climate change, extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years [9]. The long-term warming trend is directly related to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and it is the main driving force behind record temperatures [3]. In fact, the world was 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer in July than pre-industrial times, according to Copernicus' measurement [3].

The effects of global warming are widespread and varied, including more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, and storms [1]. Climate change is also causing rising sea levels, eroding shorelines, and destroying homes [8]. Furthermore, climate change is having a significant impact on the economy, with 75% of American households expecting their expenses to increase during the summer and cause them financial strain [8]. It is essential to address the root causes of global warming to mitigate its effects and prevent further warming.

Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to a global average temperature increase. Scientists say that without human-caused climate change, extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years [9]. The long-term warming trend is directly related to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and it is the main driving force behind record temperatures [3]. In fact, the world was 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer in July than pre-industrial times, according to Copernicus' measurement [3].

The effects of global warming are widespread and varied, including more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, and storms [1]. Climate change is also causing rising sea levels, eroding shorelines, and destroying homes [8]. Furthermore, climate change is having a significant impact on the economy, with 75% of American households expecting their expenses to increase during the summer and cause them financial strain [8]. It is essential to address the root causes of global warming to mitigate its effects and prevent further warming. As Christiana Figueres, former head of U.N. climate negotiations, said, "we all scorch and fry" if the world doesn't immediately change course [9].
