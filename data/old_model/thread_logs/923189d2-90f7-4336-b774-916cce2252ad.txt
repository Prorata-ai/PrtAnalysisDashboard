Although the sources do not provide detailed information about this event, it is mentioned in Source 3 that natural disasters cause substantial property and economic damage to the U.S. every year, but because of better building quality, they have far fewer fatalities than similar events in developing countries, such as the earthquake in Turkey and Syria [3]. 

Additionally, 2023 was also marked by severe wildfires, particularly in Hawaii, which cost insurance companies $61.5 billion [2]. These wildfires were part of a string of severe storms that caused massive property damage and weighed down the insurance industry. Furthermore, high inflation driven by climate change has driven up the cost of paying out customers' claims

Additionally, 2023 was also marked by severe wildfires, particularly in Hawaii, which cost insurance companies $61.5 billion [2]. These wildfires were part of a string of severe storms that caused massive property damage and weighed down the insurance industry. Furthermore, high inflation driven by climate change has driven up the cost of paying out customers' claims and has made the reinsurance policies that companies buy to protect themselves from losses more expensive [2].

2024-11-08 06:51:46,413: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: In 2023, a devastating earthquake hit Turkey and Syria, causing significant global impact. Although the sources do not provide detailed information about this event, it is mentioned in Source 3 that natural disasters cause substantial property and economic damage to the U.S. every year, but because of better building quality, they have far fewer fatalities than similar events in developing countries, such as the earthquake in Turkey and Syria [3]. 

Additionally, 2023 was also marked by severe wildfires, particularly in Hawaii, which cost insurance companies $61.5 billion [2]. These wildfires were part of a string of severe storms that caused massive property damage and weighed down the insurance industry. Furthermore, high inflation driven by climate change has driven up the cost of paying out customers' claims and has made the reinsurance policies that companies buy to protect themselves from losses more expensive [2].

2024-11-08 06:51:46,673: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: In 2023, a devastating earthquake hit Turkey and Syria, causing significant global impact. Although the sources do not provide detailed information about this event, it is mentioned in Source 3 that natural disasters cause substantial property and economic damage to the U.S. every year, but because of better building quality, they have far fewer fatalities than similar events in developing countries, such as the earthquake in Turkey and Syria [3]. 

Additionally, 2023 was also marked by severe wildfires, particularly in Hawaii, which cost insurance companies $61.5 billion [2]. These wildfires were part of a string of severe storms that caused massive property damage and weighed down the insurance industry. Furthermore, high inflation driven by climate change has driven up the cost of paying out customers' claims and has made the reinsurance policies that companies buy to protect themselves from losses more expensive [2].

Although the sources do not provide detailed information about this event, it is mentioned in Source 3 that natural disasters cause substantial property and economic damage to the U.S. every year, but because of better building quality, they have far fewer fatalities than similar events in developing countries, such as the earthquake in Turkey and Syria [3]. 

Additionally, 2023 was also marked by severe wildfires, particularly in Hawaii, which cost insurance companies $61.5 billion [2].

2024-11-08 06:51:47,243: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: In 2023, a devastating earthquake hit Turkey and Syria, causing significant global impact. Although the sources do not provide detailed information about this event, it is mentioned in Source 3 that natural disasters cause substantial property and economic damage to the U.S. every year, but because of better building quality, they have far fewer fatalities than similar events in developing countries, such as the earthquake in Turkey and Syria [3]. 

Additionally, 2023 was also marked by severe wildfires, particularly in Hawaii, which cost insurance companies $61.5 billion [2]. These wildfires were part of a string of severe storms that caused massive property damage and weighed down the insurance industry. Furthermore, high inflation driven by climate change has driven up the cost of paying out customers' claims and has made the reinsurance policies that companies buy to protect themselves from losses more expensive [2].

In the same year, the world experienced other extreme weather events, including a record-breaking number of billion-dollar loss events from convective storms, which further strained the insurance industry [2].

Additionally, 2023 was also marked by severe wildfires, particularly in Hawaii, which cost insurance companies $61.5 billion [2]. These wildfires were part of a string of severe storms that caused massive property damage and weighed down the insurance industry. Furthermore, high inflation driven by climate change has driven up the cost of paying out customers' claims and has made the reinsurance policies that companies buy to protect themselves from losses more expensive [2].

In the same year, the world experienced other extreme weather events, including a record-breaking number of billion-dollar loss events from convective storms, which further strained the insurance industry [2]. These events highlight the significant global impact of natural disasters in 2023, both in terms of human lives lost and economic costs incurred.
