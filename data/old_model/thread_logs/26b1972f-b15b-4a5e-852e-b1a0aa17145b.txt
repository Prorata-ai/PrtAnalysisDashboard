Discussions regarding future inflation rates usually probe the subtleties of monetary and fiscal policies. These are important variables in determining the outcome of any specific inflationary equation. But, at the source, peacetime inflation is a political problem, not an economic problem. Human, behavior, not monetary behavior, is the key. And when very human politicians choose between the next election and the next generation, it's clear what usually happens.

These are important variables in determining the outcome of any specific inflationary equation. But, at the source, peacetime inflation is a political problem, not an economic problem. Human, behavior, not monetary behavior, is the key. And when very human politicians choose between the next election and the next generation, it's clear what usually happens.

Most of those in political office, quite understandably, are firmly against inflation and firmly in favor of policies producing it. (This schizophrenia hasn't caused them to lose touch with reality, however; Congressmen have made sure that their pensions -- unlike practically all granted in the private sector -- are indexed to cost-of-living changes after retirement.) Discussions regarding future inflation rates usually probe the subtleties of monetary and fiscal policies. These are important variables in determining the outcome of any specific inflationary equation. But, at the source, peacetime inflation is a political problem, not an economic problem. Human, behavior, not monetary behavior, is the key. And when very human politicians choose between the next election and the next generation, it's clear what usually happens.

Discussions regarding future inflation rates usually probe the subtleties of monetary and fiscal policies. These are important variables in determining the outcome of any specific inflationary equation. But, at the source, peacetime inflation is a political problem, not an economic problem. Human, behavior, not monetary behavior, is the key. And when very human politicians choose between the next election and the next generation, it's clear what usually happens. Such broad generalizations do not produce precise numbers. However, it seems quite possible to me that inflation rates will average 7% in future years. I hope this forecast proves to be wrong.

It peaked at 9.1% <https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-prices-consumer-74e1a5c9bced40460e4079f62e980095> in the U.S. in June 2022.\n\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs <https://fortune.com/company/goldman-sachs-group/> projected earlier this week that core inflation will drop to 3% by December 2024.

For some nations, the trip’s been a wild rollercoaster ride, a lurching ascent towards a summit where the houses below look like Monopoly pieces, followed by a steep, head-spinning drop. For others, the journey has resembled a snowmobile’s wintry climb up a low, sloping hill, and the gliding descent down the other side. Only the general, up-and-down pattern is the same. But some nations never experienced a steep inflation jump at all. Put simply, “Big Inflation” wasn’t a global phenomenon.\n\nOur research into the link between money supply and inflation in 27 countries since 2020 shows that where the roller-coaster scourge happened, as in the U.S., the cause was a huge, misguided spike in the money supply. In countries where M2 (a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and other deposits readily convertible to cash) rose only gradually, the price rise proved moderate and didn’t require draconian, potentially growth-crushing measures to correct.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/fed-chair-jerome-powell-inflation-rollercoaster-money-supply-absent-economy-finance-politics/\n\nSource 2:\nThe recent ups and downs in inflation echo Milton Friedman’s dictum: “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” They also mirror Friedman\'s findings on the lag of roughly two years <https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/2023/may/examining-long-variable-lags-monetary-policy> between changes in the stock of money and changes in inflation. In the 27 countries we studied, the mean and median lags witnessed in the 2020-24 inflation rollercoaster were 23.9 and 23 months, respectively.\n\nHaving failed to predict the recent ups and downs in the course of inflation, central bankers and contemporary macroeconomists should throw away their scripts and models and start paying attention to the strong causal link between changes in the stock of money and inflation.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/fed-chair-jerome-powell-inflation-rollercoaster-money-supply-absent-economy-finance-politics/\n\nSource 3:\nThe issue remains a heated one in the political campaign. Seeking to capitalize on public discontent, former President Donald Trump has blamed the Biden-Harris administration\'s policies for having caused inflation to spike. Yet Friday\'s AP poll found that voters are now roughly split on who they think would better handle the economy, Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris. Back in June, an AP poll had found that six in 10 disapproved of President Joe Biden\'s economic record.\n\nThat is a sign that, at least seen through a political prism, Americans\' economic views have begun to brighten.\n\nLittle noticed in a news conference Chair Jerome Powell gave Wednesday was his estimate that the Fed\'s preferred inflation gauge would amount to just 2.2% for August when the figure is released this week. That would be down dramatically from a peak of 7% two years ago.\n\nPowell also provided a colloquial definition of the Fed\'s mandate to seek “price stability.”\n\n“A good definition of price stability," he said, "is that people in their daily decisions, they’re not thinking about inflation. That’s where everyone wants to be — back to, ‘What’s inflation?’ Just keep it low, keep it stable.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/23/fed-thinks-won-inflation-fight-most-americans-unhappy-economy/\n\nSource 4:\n“Central bankers think even if inflation gets away from 2% for a period, as long as it comes back, that’s fine,” Forbes said. "Victory, mission accomplished. But the amount of time inflation is away from 2% can have a major cost.”\n\nResearch by Stefanie Stantcheva <https://socialeconomicslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Understanding_Inflation_BNS.pdf>, a Harvard economist, and two colleagues found that most people\'s views of inflation are very different from those of economists. Economists in general are more likely to regard inflation as a consequence of strong growth. They often describe inflation as a result of an “overheating” economy: Low unemployment, strong job growth and rising wages lead businesses to sharply increase prices without necessarily losing sales.\n\nBy contrast, a survey by Stantcheva found, ordinary Americans “view inflation as an unambiguously bad thing and very rarely as a sign of a good economy or as a byproduct of positive developments.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/03/fed-predicting-soft-landing-americans-not-ready-celebrate/\n\nSource 5:\nInflation and wage growth\n\nAt an August rally, Trump criticized <https://www.fox28savannah.com/news/nation-world/trump-blames-harris-radical-liberal-policies-for-inflation-at-pennsylvania-rally-2024-election-politics> Harris\' "radical liberal policies…[that] have caused horrific inflation," blaming Bidenomics for the rapid rise in prices since 2020 <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL>.\n\nSuch claims oversimplify the sources of inflation and insult the intelligence of voters. Blaming Harris for Bidenomics is a highly contested topic even among economists <https://abcnews.go.com/Business/republicans-rnc-blame-biden-inflation-economists-misleading/story?id=112022864> with no political motive. Inflation can be attributed to five sources <https://fortune.com/2024/08/29/inflation-housing-immigration-taxes-the-harris-walz-economic-policy-scorecard/?abc123>, most of which could be attributed to COVID-19 and idiosyncratic supply shocks, factors no president could control.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/06/harris-must-awaken-the-nation-from-the-sleeper-effect-at-the-debate-with-trump-and-dispel-the-oft-repeated-falsehood-that-the-booming-u-s-economy-isnt-doing-so-well/\n\nSource 6:\nbe to compound long-term pain. Most of those in political office, quite understandably, are firmly against inflation and firmly in favor of policies producing it. (This schizophrenia hasn\'t caused them to lose touch with reality, however; Congressmen have made sure that their pensions -- unlike practically all granted in the private sector -- are indexed to cost-of-living changes after retirement.) Discussions regarding future inflation rates usually probe the subtleties of monetary and fiscal policies. These are important variables in determining the outcome of any specific inflationary equation. But, at the source, peacetime inflation is a political problem, not an economic problem. Human, behavior, not monetary behavior, is the key. And when very human politicians choose between the next election and the next generation, it\'s clear what usually happens. Such broad generalizations do not produce precise numbers. However, it seems quite possible to me that inflation rates will average 7% in future years. I hope this forecast proves to be wrong. And it may well be. Forecasts usually tell us more of the forecaster than of the future. You are free to factor your own inflation rate into the investor\'s equation. But if you foresee a rate averaging 2% or 3%, you are wearing different glasses than I\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/buffett-how-inflation-swindles-the-equity-investor-fortune-classics-1977/\n\nSource 7:\nStubbornly high inflation has been showing signs of abating in recent months, but one prominent research firm is betting it’s set to rise. And the reason? To paraphrase a Clinton-era political saying, it’s the election, stupid.\n\nRegardless of whether Joe Biden or Donald Trump wins a coveted second term, inflation will increase, predicts the research firm Oxford Economics. The question is how much. Both presidents’ policies are inflationary, albeit in different ways, Oxford says. And while the broad trend lines of the economy will remain the same regardless of who controls the White House or Congress, how steep they end up being could change drastically from one political reality to another. \n\n“It\'s only the degree to which GDP and inflation are higher under the next president that differs depending on the political configuration,” wrote Oxford Economics deputy chief U.S. economist Bernard Yaros Jr. in a research note published last week. \n\nUnder a Trump presidency, peak inflation would be 0.6 percentage points higher than the current 3.3%, according to Oxford Economics’ analysis. That means inflation would reach 3.8%. Under Biden, Oxford predicts, inflation would be just 0.1% higher than it is now.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/10/trump-biden-election-inflation-economy-federal-reserve-jerome-powell-united-states/\n\nSource 8:\nThough faster wage growth provides a boost for workers, it can also fuel inflation if companies pass on their higher labor costs to consumers by raising prices.\n\nTaken as a whole, the latest signs of a sustained cooling of inflation arrive five days before an election in which many voters have soured on the economy, mostly because average prices remain nearly 20% higher than they were four years ago. Former President Donald Trump has largely blamed the Biden-Harris administration\'s energy policies and promised that inflation would “ vanish completely <https://apnews.com/article/trump-inflation-tariffs-taxes-immigration-federal-reserve-a18de763fcc01557258c7f33cab375ed> ” if he is elected. Vice President Kamala Harris has promised to ban price gouging for groceries and to reduce child care and health care costs.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/31/federal-reserve-inflation-lowest-level-pandemic-prices/\n\nSource 9:\nThe public debate about inflation has caught on to what economists have long known: Price change—aka inflation—and prices are not the same thing. Though inflation has fallen back sharply over the last two years, prices have not dropped—they have merely risen more slowly. And while politicians promise lower prices on the campaign trail, the dirty little secret is that nobody wants prices to fall across the board. Falling prices constitute deflation, inflation’s ugly cousin.\n\nSo, are American voters stuck on a plateau of higher prices? Not quite. Wages matter just as much as prices. If the prices of all goods doubled in one year, consumers would face dire circumstances. But if wages also doubled, any financial injury would be largely psychological. What ultimately matters is price affordability—the ratio of prices and wages.\n\nPrice affordability in America\n\nSince 2019, consumer prices are up nearly 20%, a painful surge after years of tame price growth in the pre-pandemic era. However, wages are up more than 25% over the same period. As a result, price affordability in aggregate is actually 5% better than it was in 2019.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/23/inflation-american-consumers-better-off-than-2019-prices-economy/\n\nSource 10:\nBarkin noted that before the pandemic, inflation remained low as online shopping, which makes price comparisons easy, became increasingly prevalent.

Discussions regarding future inflation rates usually probe the subtleties of monetary and fiscal policies. These are important variables in determining the outcome of any specific inflationary equation. But, at the source, peacetime inflation is a political problem, not an economic problem. Human, behavior, not monetary behavior, is the key. And when very human politicians choose between the next election and the next generation, it\'s clear what usually happens. Such broad generalizations do not produce precise numbers. However, it seems quite possible to me that inflation rates will average 7% in future years. I hope this forecast proves to be wrong.

And the reason? To paraphrase a Clinton-era political saying, it’s the election, stupid.\n\nRegardless of whether Joe Biden or Donald Trump wins a coveted second term, inflation will increase, predicts the research firm Oxford Economics. The question is how much. Both presidents’ policies are inflationary, albeit in different ways, Oxford says. And while the broad trend lines of the economy will remain the same regardless of who controls the White House or Congress, how steep they end up being could change drastically from one political reality to another. \n\n“It\'s only the degree to which GDP and inflation are higher under the next president that differs depending on the political configuration,” wrote Oxford Economics deputy chief U.S. economist Bernard Yaros Jr. in a research note published last week. \n\nUnder a Trump presidency, peak inflation would be 0.6 percentage points higher than the current 3.3%, according to Oxford Economics’ analysis. That means inflation would reach 3.8%. Under Biden, Oxford predicts, inflation would be just 0.1% higher than it is now.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/10/trump-biden-election-inflation-economy-federal-reserve-jerome-powell-united-states/\n\nSource 8:\nThough faster wage growth provides a boost for workers, it can also fuel inflation if companies pass on their higher labor costs to consumers by raising prices.\n\nTaken as a whole, the latest signs of a sustained cooling of inflation arrive five days before an election in which many voters have soured on the economy, mostly because average prices remain nearly 20% higher than they were four years ago. Former President Donald Trump has largely blamed the Biden-Harris administration\'s energy policies and promised that inflation would “ vanish completely <https://apnews.com/article/trump-inflation-tariffs-taxes-immigration-federal-reserve-a18de763fcc01557258c7f33cab375ed> ” if he is elected.

Though inflation has fallen back sharply over the last two years, prices have not dropped—they have merely risen more slowly. And while politicians promise lower prices on the campaign trail, the dirty little secret is that nobody wants prices to fall across the board. Falling prices constitute deflation, inflation’s ugly cousin.\n\nSo, are American voters stuck on a plateau of higher prices? Not quite. Wages matter just as much as prices. If the prices of all goods doubled in one year, consumers would face dire circumstances. But if wages also doubled, any financial injury would be largely psychological. What ultimately matters is price affordability—the ratio of prices and wages.\n\nPrice affordability in America\n\nSince 2019, consumer prices are up nearly 20%, a painful surge after years of tame price growth in the pre-pandemic era. However, wages are up more than 25% over the same period. As a result, price affordability in aggregate is actually 5% better than it was in 2019.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/23/inflation-american-consumers-better-off-than-2019-prices-economy/\n\nSource 10:\nBarkin noted that before the pandemic, inflation remained low as online shopping, which makes price comparisons easy, became increasingly prevalent.

And the reason? To paraphrase a Clinton-era political saying, it’s the election, stupid.\n\nRegardless of whether Joe Biden or Donald Trump wins a coveted second term, inflation will increase, predicts the research firm Oxford Economics. The question is how much. Both presidents’ policies are inflationary, albeit in different ways, Oxford says. And while the broad trend lines of the economy will remain the same regardless of who controls the White House or Congress, how steep they end up being could change drastically from one political reality to another. \n\n“It\'s only the degree to which GDP and inflation are higher under the next president that differs depending on the political configuration,” wrote Oxford Economics deputy chief U.S. economist Bernard Yaros Jr. in a research note published last week. \n\nUnder a Trump presidency, peak inflation would be 0.6 percentage points higher than the current 3.3%, according to Oxford Economics’ analysis. That means inflation would reach 3.8%. Under Biden, Oxford predicts, inflation would be just 0.1% higher than it is now.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/10/trump-biden-election-inflation-economy-federal-reserve-jerome-powell-united-states/\n\nSource 8:\nThough faster wage growth provides a boost for workers, it can also fuel inflation if companies pass on their higher labor costs to consumers by raising prices.\n\nTaken as a whole, the latest signs of a sustained cooling of inflation arrive five days before an election in which many voters have soured on the economy, mostly because average prices remain nearly 20% higher than they were four years ago.

Though inflation has fallen back sharply over the last two years, prices have not dropped—they have merely risen more slowly. And while politicians promise lower prices on the campaign trail, the dirty little secret is that nobody wants prices to fall across the board. Falling prices constitute deflation, inflation’s ugly cousin.\n\nSo, are American voters stuck on a plateau of higher prices? Not quite. Wages matter just as much as prices. If the prices of all goods doubled in one year, consumers would face dire circumstances. But if wages also doubled, any financial injury would be largely psychological. What ultimately matters is price affordability—the ratio of prices and wages.\n\nPrice affordability in America\n\nSince 2019, consumer prices are up nearly 20%, a painful surge after years of tame price growth in the pre-pandemic era. However, wages are up more than 25% over the same period. As a result, price affordability in aggregate is actually 5% better than it was in 2019.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/23/inflation-american-consumers-better-off-than-2019-prices-economy/\n\nSource 10:\nBarkin noted that before the pandemic, inflation remained low as online shopping, which makes price comparisons easy, became increasingly prevalent. Major retailers also held down costs, and increased U.S. oil production brought down gas prices.\n\n“A price increase was so rare," Barkin said, “that if someone came to you with a 5% or 10% price increase, you almost just threw them out, like, ‘How could you possibly do it?’ ”\n\nThat changed in 2021.\n\n“There are labor shortages, Barkin said. “Supply chain shortages.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine worsened energy and food shortages, pushing inflation higher. It peaked at 9.1% <https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-prices-consumer-74e1a5c9bced40460e4079f62e980095> in the U.S. in June 2022.\n\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs <https://fortune.com/company/goldman-sachs-group/> projected earlier this week that core inflation will drop to 3% by December 2024.

For some nations, the trip’s been a wild rollercoaster ride, a lurching ascent towards a summit where the houses below look like Monopoly pieces, followed by a steep, head-spinning drop. For others, the journey has resembled a snowmobile’s wintry climb up a low, sloping hill, and the gliding descent down the other side. Only the general, up-and-down pattern is the same. But some nations never experienced a steep inflation jump at all. Put simply, “Big Inflation” wasn’t a global phenomenon.\n\nOur research into the link between money supply and inflation in 27 countries since 2020 shows that where the roller-coaster scourge happened, as in the U.S., the cause was a huge, misguided spike in the money supply. In countries where M2 (a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and other deposits readily convertible to cash) rose only gradually, the price rise proved moderate and didn’t require draconian, potentially growth-crushing measures to correct.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/fed-chair-jerome-powell-inflation-rollercoaster-money-supply-absent-economy-finance-politics/\n\nSource 2:\nThe recent ups and downs in inflation echo Milton Friedman’s dictum: “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” They also mirror Friedman\'s findings on the lag of roughly two years <https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/2023/may/examining-long-variable-lags-monetary-policy> between changes in the stock of money and changes in inflation. In the 27 countries we studied, the mean and median lags witnessed in the 2020-24 inflation rollercoaster were 23.9 and 23 months, respectively.\n\nHaving failed to predict the recent ups and downs in the course of inflation, central bankers and contemporary macroeconomists should throw away their scripts and models and start paying attention to the strong causal link between changes in the stock of money and inflation.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/fed-chair-jerome-powell-inflation-rollercoaster-money-supply-absent-economy-finance-politics/\n\nSource 3:\nThe issue remains a heated one in the political campaign. Seeking to capitalize on public discontent, former President Donald Trump has blamed the Biden-Harris administration\'s policies for having caused inflation to spike. Yet Friday\'s AP poll found that voters are now roughly split on who they think would better handle the economy, Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris. Back in June, an AP poll had found that six in 10 disapproved of President Joe Biden\'s economic record.\n\nThat is a sign that, at least seen through a political prism, Americans\' economic views have begun to brighten.\n\nLittle noticed in a news conference Chair Jerome Powell gave Wednesday was his estimate that the Fed\'s preferred inflation gauge would amount to just 2.2% for August when the figure is released this week. That would be down dramatically from a peak of 7% two years ago.\n\nPowell also provided a colloquial definition of the Fed\'s mandate to seek “price stability.”\n\n“A good definition of price stability," he said, "is that people in their daily decisions, they’re not thinking about inflation. That’s where everyone wants to be — back to, ‘What’s inflation?’ Just keep it low, keep it stable.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/23/fed-thinks-won-inflation-fight-most-americans-unhappy-economy/\n\nSource 4:\n“Central bankers think even if inflation gets away from 2% for a period, as long as it comes back, that’s fine,” Forbes said. "Victory, mission accomplished. But the amount of time inflation is away from 2% can have a major cost.”\n\nResearch by Stefanie Stantcheva <https://socialeconomicslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Understanding_Inflation_BNS.pdf>, a Harvard economist, and two colleagues found that most people\'s views of inflation are very different from those of economists. Economists in general are more likely to regard inflation as a consequence of strong growth. They often describe inflation as a result of an “overheating” economy: Low unemployment, strong job growth and rising wages lead businesses to sharply increase prices without necessarily losing sales.\n\nBy contrast, a survey by Stantcheva found, ordinary Americans “view inflation as an unambiguously bad thing and very rarely as a sign of a good economy or as a byproduct of positive developments.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/03/fed-predicting-soft-landing-americans-not-ready-celebrate/\n\nSource 5:\nInflation and wage growth\n\nAt an August rally, Trump criticized <https://www.fox28savannah.com/news/nation-world/trump-blames-harris-radical-liberal-policies-for-inflation-at-pennsylvania-rally-2024-election-politics> Harris\' "radical liberal policies…[that] have caused horrific inflation," blaming Bidenomics for the rapid rise in prices since 2020 <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL>.\n\nSuch claims oversimplify the sources of inflation and insult the intelligence of voters.

Most of those in political office, quite understandably, are firmly against inflation and firmly in favor of policies producing it. (This schizophrenia hasn\'t caused them to lose touch with reality, however; Congressmen have made sure that their pensions -- unlike practically all granted in the private sector -- are indexed to cost-of-living changes after retirement.) Discussions regarding future inflation rates usually probe the subtleties of monetary and fiscal policies. These are important variables in determining the outcome of any specific inflationary equation. But, at the source, peacetime inflation is a political problem, not an economic problem. Human, behavior, not monetary behavior, is the key. And when very human politicians choose between the next election and the next generation, it\'s clear what usually happens. Such broad generalizations do not produce precise numbers. However, it seems quite possible to me that inflation rates will average 7% in future years. I hope this forecast proves to be wrong.

2024-11-08 06:37:26,131: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Inflation is a complex and multifaceted concept, but at its core, it refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. According to Milton Friedman, a renowned economist, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" [2]. This means that inflation is primarily caused by an increase in the money supply, which can lead to a surge in demand for goods and services, driving up prices.

Inflation can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the economy but also individuals and businesses. As prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases, reducing the value of savings and fixed income. For instance, if inflation is high, a person's salary may not keep pace with the rising cost of living, leading to a decrease in their standard of living [9].

2024-11-08 06:37:26,428: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Inflation is a complex and multifaceted concept, but at its core, it refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. According to Milton Friedman, a renowned economist, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" [2]. This means that inflation is primarily caused by an increase in the money supply, which can lead to a surge in demand for goods and services, driving up prices.

Inflation can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the economy but also individuals and businesses. As prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases, reducing the value of savings and fixed income. For instance, if inflation is high, a person's salary may not keep pace with the rising cost of living, leading to a decrease in their standard of living [9].

2024-11-08 06:37:26,681: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Inflation is a complex and multifaceted concept, but at its core, it refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. According to Milton Friedman, a renowned economist, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" [2]. This means that inflation is primarily caused by an increase in the money supply, which can lead to a surge in demand for goods and services, driving up prices.

Inflation can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the economy but also individuals and businesses. As prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases, reducing the value of savings and fixed income. For instance, if inflation is high, a person's salary may not keep pace with the rising cost of living, leading to a decrease in their standard of living [9]. On the other hand, some economists argue that a moderate level of inflation can be beneficial for economic growth, as it can stimulate spending and investment [4].

2024-11-08 06:37:26,928: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Inflation is a complex and multifaceted concept, but at its core, it refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. According to Milton Friedman, a renowned economist, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" [2]. This means that inflation is primarily caused by an increase in the money supply, which can lead to a surge in demand for goods and services, driving up prices.

Inflation can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the economy but also individuals and businesses. As prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases, reducing the value of savings and fixed income. For instance, if inflation is high, a person's salary may not keep pace with the rising cost of living, leading to a decrease in their standard of living [9]. On the other hand, some economists argue that a moderate level of inflation can be beneficial for economic growth, as it can stimulate spending and investment [4].

2024-11-08 06:37:28,148: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Inflation is a complex and multifaceted concept, but at its core, it refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. According to Milton Friedman, a renowned economist, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" [2]. This means that inflation is primarily caused by an increase in the money supply, which can lead to a surge in demand for goods and services, driving up prices.

Inflation can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the economy but also individuals and businesses. As prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases, reducing the value of savings and fixed income. For instance, if inflation is high, a person's salary may not keep pace with the rising cost of living, leading to a decrease in their standard of living [9]. On the other hand, some economists argue that a moderate level of inflation can be beneficial for economic growth, as it can stimulate spending and investment [4].

2024-11-08 06:37:28,308: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Inflation is a complex and multifaceted concept, but at its core, it refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. According to Milton Friedman, a renowned economist, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" [2]. This means that inflation is primarily caused by an increase in the money supply, which can lead to a surge in demand for goods and services, driving up prices.

Inflation can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the economy but also individuals and businesses. As prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases, reducing the value of savings and fixed income. For instance, if inflation is high, a person's salary may not keep pace with the rising cost of living, leading to a decrease in their standard of living [9]. On the other hand, some economists argue that a moderate level of inflation can be beneficial for economic growth, as it can stimulate spending and investment [4].

The recent experience with inflation in the United States and other countries has been marked by a significant surge in prices, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to data, inflation peaked at 9

2024-11-08 06:37:28,503: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Inflation is a complex and multifaceted concept, but at its core, it refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. According to Milton Friedman, a renowned economist, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" [2]. This means that inflation is primarily caused by an increase in the money supply, which can lead to a surge in demand for goods and services, driving up prices.

Inflation can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the economy but also individuals and businesses. As prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases, reducing the value of savings and fixed income. For instance, if inflation is high, a person's salary may not keep pace with the rising cost of living, leading to a decrease in their standard of living [9].

2024-11-08 06:37:28,698: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Inflation is a complex and multifaceted concept, but at its core, it refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. According to Milton Friedman, a renowned economist, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" [2]. This means that inflation is primarily caused by an increase in the money supply, which can lead to a surge in demand for goods and services, driving up prices.

Inflation can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the economy but also individuals and businesses. As prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases, reducing the value of savings and fixed income. For instance, if inflation is high, a person's salary may not keep pace with the rising cost of living, leading to a decrease in their standard of living [9]. On the other hand, some economists argue that a moderate level of inflation can be beneficial for economic growth, as it can stimulate spending and investment [4].

The recent experience with inflation in the United States and other countries has been marked by a significant surge in prices, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to data, inflation peaked at 9.1% in the US in June 2022, before slowly declining [1]. The Federal Reserve

2024-11-08 06:37:29,086: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Inflation is a complex and multifaceted concept, but at its core, it refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. According to Milton Friedman, a renowned economist, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" [2]. This means that inflation is primarily caused by an increase in the money supply, which can lead to a surge in demand for goods and services, driving up prices.

Inflation can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the economy but also individuals and businesses. As prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases, reducing the value of savings and fixed income. For instance, if inflation is high, a person's salary may not keep pace with the rising cost of living, leading to a decrease in their standard of living [9]. On the other hand, some economists argue that a moderate level of inflation can be beneficial for economic growth, as it can stimulate spending and investment [4].

The recent experience with inflation in the United States and other countries has been marked by a significant surge in prices, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to data, inflation peaked at 9.1% in the US in June 2022, before slowly declining [1]. The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, aims to keep inflation at a

2024-11-08 06:37:29,362: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Inflation is a complex and multifaceted concept, but at its core, it refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. According to Milton Friedman, a renowned economist, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" [2]. This means that inflation is primarily caused by an increase in the money supply, which can lead to a surge in demand for goods and services, driving up prices.

Inflation can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the economy but also individuals and businesses. As prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases, reducing the value of savings and fixed income. For instance, if inflation is high, a person's salary may not keep pace with the rising cost of living, leading to a decrease in their standard of living [9]. On the other hand, some economists argue that a moderate level of inflation can be beneficial for economic growth, as it can stimulate spending and investment [4].

2024-11-08 06:37:29,547: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Inflation is a complex and multifaceted concept, but at its core, it refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. According to Milton Friedman, a renowned economist, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" [2]. This means that inflation is primarily caused by an increase in the money supply, which can lead to a surge in demand for goods and services, driving up prices.

Inflation can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the economy but also individuals and businesses. As prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases, reducing the value of savings and fixed income. For instance, if inflation is high, a person's salary may not keep pace with the rising cost of living, leading to a decrease in their standard of living [9]. On the other hand, some economists argue that a moderate level of inflation can be beneficial for economic growth, as it can stimulate spending and investment [4].

The recent experience with inflation in the United States and other countries has been marked by a significant surge in prices, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to data, inflation peaked at 9.1% in the US in June 2022, before slowly declining [1]. The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, aims to keep inflation at a target rate of 2%, which is considered a healthy level for economic growth [3]. However, achieving this target can be challenging, and the Fed must carefully balance

As prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases, reducing the value of savings and fixed income. For instance, if inflation is high, a person's salary may not keep pace with the rising cost of living, leading to a decrease in their standard of living [9]. On the other hand, some economists argue that a moderate level of inflation can be beneficial for economic growth, as it can stimulate spending and investment [4].

The recent experience with inflation in the United States and other countries has been marked by a significant surge in prices, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to data, inflation peaked at 9.1% in the US in June 2022, before slowly declining [1]. The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, aims to keep inflation at a target rate of 2%, which is considered a healthy level for economic growth [3]. However, achieving this target can be challenging, and the Fed must carefully balance monetary policy to avoid overheating the economy or triggering a recession

However, achieving this target can be challenging, and the Fed must carefully balance monetary policy to avoid overheating the economy or triggering a recession.

2024-11-08 06:37:29,879: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Inflation is a complex and multifaceted concept, but at its core, it refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. According to Milton Friedman, a renowned economist, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" [2]. This means that inflation is primarily caused by an increase in the money supply, which can lead to a surge in demand for goods and services, driving up prices.

Inflation can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the economy but also individuals and businesses. As prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases, reducing the value of savings and fixed income. For instance, if inflation is high, a person's salary may not keep pace with the rising cost of living, leading to a decrease in their standard of living [9]. On the other hand, some economists argue that a moderate level of inflation can be beneficial for economic growth, as it can stimulate spending and investment [4].

The recent experience with inflation in the United States and other countries has been marked by a significant surge in prices, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
