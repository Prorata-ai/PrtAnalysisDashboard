The support ship Polar Prince then sent repeated messages asking if Titan could still see the ship on its onboard display.\n\nOne of the last messages from Titan’s crew to Polar Prince before the submersible imploded stated, “all good here,” according to a visual re-creation presented earlier in the hearing.\n\nWhen the submersible was reported overdue, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said.

When it was reported overdue that afternoon, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to the area, about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland.\n\nThe U.S. Navy notified the Coast Guard that day of an anomaly in its acoustic data that was “consistent with an implosion or explosion” at the time communications between the Polar Prince and the Titan were lost, a senior Navy official <https://apnews.com/article/missing-titanic-submersible-updates-93a59c3c1d48aee2feef46caca418fd1> later told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive technology.\n\nAny sliver of hope that remained for finding the crew alive was wiped away on June 22, when the Coast Guard announced that debris had been found near the Titanic on the ocean floor. Authorities have since recovered the submersible’s intact endcap, debris and presumed human remains from the site.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/17/oceangate-titan-imploded-titanic-ohio-real-estate-billionaire-plans-voyage-2026/\n\nSource 1:\nThe deadly implosion <https://apnews.com/article/titanic-shipwreck-titan-submersible-search-deepsea-atlantic-implosion-90b9c54c3887c99099170a5afded15bc> of an experimental submersible en route to the deep-sea grave of the Titanic last June has not dulled the desire for further ocean exploration, despite lingering questions about the disaster.\n\nTuesday marks one year since the Titan vanished on its way <https://apnews.com/article/missing-titanic-submersible-updates-6255308420cb542fab287224c3e9b1c1> to the historic wreckage site in the North Atlantic Ocean. After a five-day search that captured attention around the world, authorities said the vessel had been destroyed and all five people on board had died.\nConcerns have been raised about whether the Titan was destined for disaster because of its unconventional design and its creator’s refusal to submit to independent checks that are standard in the industry. The U.S. Coast Guard quickly convened a high-level investigation <https://apnews.com/article/titan-submersible-investigation-91bde867ef100c769f1dbe293f2b3020> into what happened, but officials said the inquiry is taking longer than the initial 12-month time frame, and a planned public hearing to discuss their findings won’t happen for at least another two months.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/17/oceangate-titan-imploded-titanic-ohio-real-estate-billionaire-plans-voyage-2026/\n\nSource 1:\nOceanGate, a company co-founded by Rush that owned the submersible, suspended operations in early July. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment.\n\nDavid Concannon, a former adviser to OceanGate, said he will mark the anniversary privately with a group of people who were involved with the company or the submersible\'s expeditions over the years, including scientists, volunteers and mission specialists. Many of them, including those who were on the Titan support ship Polar Prince, have not been interviewed by the Coast Guard, he said.\n\n“The fact is, they are isolated and in a liminal space," he said in an email last week. “Stockton Rush has been vilified and so has everyone associated with OceanGate. I wasn’t even there and I have gotten death threats. We support each other and just wait to be interviewed. The world has moved on ... but the families and those most affected are still living with this tragedy every day.”\n\nThe Titan had been chronicling the Titanic’s decay and the underwater ecosystem around the sunken ocean liner in yearly voyages since 2021.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/17/oceangate-titan-imploded-titanic-ohio-real-estate-billionaire-plans-voyage-2026/\n\nSource 2:\nWitnesses testified they had heard loud cracking sounds in past descents. And scientific director Steven Ross said that, on a dive just a few days before the Titan imploded, the vessel became unstable because of a ballast problem, causing passengers to tumble and crash into a bulkhead.\n\nDuring its final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts as it descended. One of the last messages from Titan’s crew to the Polar Prince support ship before the submersible imploded stated, “all good here.” The crew of Polar Prince, meanwhile, grew increasingly concerned.\n\nShips, planes and other equipment assembled for a rescue operation about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/27/titan-hearing-ignored-warnings-put-profits-over-people-explorers-spirit/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/27/titan-hearing-ignored-warnings-put-profits-over-people-explorers-spirit/\n\nSource 2:\nKilled in the implosion were Rush and four others including Paul-Henri Nargeolet <https://apnews.com/article/titanic-artifacts-titan-nargeolet-law-grave-30c7316144e1233ded7bf2ad149576dd>, who was director of underwater research for RMS Titanic, which holds the legal rights to salvage the wreck of the ship. Nargeolet’s family is suing for more than $50 million, accusing the sub’s operator of gross negligence.\n\nThe carbon-fiber pressure hull of Titan was the subject of much of the discussion. An expert witness, Roy Thomas, senior principal engineer at the American Bureau of Shipping <https://fortune.com/company/china-cosco-shipping/>, testified that carbon-fiber may be strong and light, but that it’s tricky to manufacture. Carbon fiber also is “susceptible to fatigue failure” under repeated pressurization and salt water can weaken the material in multiple ways, he said.\n\nCoast Guard officials noted at the start of the hearing, held in South Carolina, that the submersible had not been independently reviewed, as is standard practice.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/27/titan-hearing-ignored-warnings-put-profits-over-people-explorers-spirit/\n\nSource 3:\nDuring the submersible’s final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts about Titan’s depth and weight as it descended. The support ship Polar Prince then sent repeated messages asking if Titan could still see the ship on its onboard display.\n\nOne of the last messages from Titan’s crew to Polar Prince before the submersible imploded stated, “all good here,” according to a visual re-creation presented earlier in the hearing.\n\nWhen the submersible was reported overdue, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland.

Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said.\n\nThe time frame for the investigation was initially a year, but the inquiry has taken longer.

An expert witness, Roy Thomas, senior principal engineer at the American Bureau of Shipping <https://fortune.com/company/china-cosco-shipping/>, testified that carbon-fiber may be strong and light, but that it’s tricky to manufacture.
