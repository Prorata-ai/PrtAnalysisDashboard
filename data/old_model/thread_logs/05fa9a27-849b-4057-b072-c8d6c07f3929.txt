And Prime, Amazon’s subscription business, continues to entice new signups with offerings spanning retail discounts and entertainment streaming.

2024-11-08 06:47:53,447: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The online retail company founded by Jeff Bezos is Amazon [1]. Amazon was initially an online bookstore but has since expanded to sell a wide variety of products, earning it the nickname "the everything store" [4]. Today, Amazon is one of the world's largest and most successful e-commerce companies, with a market value of hundreds of billions of dollars [1].

Under Bezos' leadership, Amazon went public in 1997 with an initial public offering (IPO) price of $18 per share [1]. Since then, the company has grown exponentially, with its shares now trading at over $185 per share [1]. Bezos' vision and leadership have been instrumental in Amazon's success, and he is widely credited with revolutionizing the retail industry [3].

Bezos' legacy at Amazon continues to shape the company's direction, even after he stepped down as CEO in 2021 to focus on philanthropy and his space exploration company, Blue Origin [6]. Andy Jassy, who took over as CEO, has continued to build on Bezos' foundation, investing in new areas such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing [9

2024-11-08 06:47:54,361: ObserveEventsHandler(  207): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd response: assistant: The online retail company founded by Jeff Bezos is Amazon [1]. Amazon was initially an online bookstore but has since expanded to sell a wide variety of products, earning it the nickname "the everything store" [4]. Today, Amazon is one of the world's largest and most successful e-commerce companies, with a market value of hundreds of billions of dollars [1].

Under Bezos' leadership, Amazon went public in 1997 with an initial public offering (IPO) price of $18 per share [1]. Since then, the company has grown exponentially, with its shares now trading at over $185 per share [1]. Bezos' vision and leadership have been instrumental in Amazon's success, and he is widely credited with revolutionizing the retail industry [3].

Bezos' legacy at Amazon continues to shape the company's direction, even after he stepped down as CEO in 2021 to focus on philanthropy and his space exploration company, Blue Origin [6]. Andy Jassy, who took over as CEO, has continued to build on Bezos' foundation, investing in new areas such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing [9]. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing competition from other retailers, Amazon remains a dominant force in the e-commerce market [4].
