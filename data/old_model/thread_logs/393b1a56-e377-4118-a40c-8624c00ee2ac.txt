Retail outlets, banks, railway companies and hospitals in several parts of the world were also affected in what appeared to be an unprecedented internet disruption.\n\nHere\'s the Latest:\n\nBanks in South Africa experience service disruptions for several hours\n\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa — In South Africa, at least two major banks said they experienced service disruptions as customers complained they weren’t able to make payments using their bank cards at grocery stores and gas stations or use ATMs. Both said they were able to restore services hours later.\n\nSouthern African regional airline Airlink also reported that its IT network and telephone lines were down because of what it called a global network outage, but said flights were not affected.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/19/cloudstrike-microsoft-massive-it-outage-not-cyberattack-security-incident-latest/\n\nSource 5:\nMany hospitals and labs across the U.S. and globally have had their systems shut down, leading some hospitals to cancel or delay procedures and surgeries. Medical staff at many facilities have had to revert to documenting everything via pen and paper and calling in prescriptions. \n\nBoston-based Brigham and Women\'s Hospital canceled <https://x.com/BrighamWomens/status/1814270590141768016https://x.com/BrighamWomens/status/1814270590141768016> all previously scheduled non-urgent surgeries, procedures, and medical visits. Cone Health, a health-care network in North Carolina, canceled treatments, procedures, and surgeries. Corewell Health, a Michigan-based health care system, issued an alert to customers that many of its computers had been impacted and that procedures and appointments could be delayed. Even labs like Labcorp said the outage impacted their ability to deliver lab results to physicians and patients—which could potentially result in delays for hospital discharges or admissions as well as treatment.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/19/crowdstrike-outage-glitch-hospitals-healthcare-doctors-computer-systems/\n\nSource 5:\nDr. Kabir recalled a cyberattack at the private hospital where he was working a year ago that also forced doctors and nurses to revert to updating patient records in writing. At the time, Dr. Kabir said cardiologists were unable to review electrocardiograms, the critical tests that measure electrical activity of the heart. "I’d say most people have done it at least one or two times,” he said.\n\nIronically, hospitals and clinics are using companies like CrowdStrike specifically to avoid these sorts of shutdowns and bolster the safety of the often outdated tech systems they rely on. The CrowdStrike episode has underscored that system shutdowns may be unavoidable.\n\nThe healthcare industry is just one of many industry\'s slammed by the outage. The glitch has shaken the entire global economy—impacting everything from airlines to television stations to government agencies. “My morning started with a 4 a.m. call from the Situation Room to highlight the issue that occurred with CrowdStrike,” Anne Neuberger, Deputy Assistant to President Biden and Deputy National Security Advisor for cyber and emerging technologies, said on stage this morning at the Aspen Security Forum, when asked about the outage.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/19/crowdstrike-outage-glitch-hospitals-healthcare-doctors-computer-systems/\n\nSource 6:\nSeveral adversarial nations have been known to use false (spoofed) GPS signals to interfere with air transit <https://australianaviation.com.au/2023/03/qantas-pilots-subject-to-gps-jamming-from-chinese-warships/>, shipping <https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1148748/War-zone-GPS-jamming-sees-more-ships-show-up-at-airports>, and trade <https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/11/15/131940/ghost-ships-crop-circles-and-soft-gold-a-gps-mystery-in-shanghai/>, or to disrupt military logistics in conflict zones.

Retail outlets, banks, railway companies and hospitals in several parts of the world were also affected in what appeared to be an unprecedented internet disruption.\n\nHere\'s the Latest:\n\nBanks in South Africa experience service disruptions for several hours\n\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa — In South Africa, at least two major banks said they experienced service disruptions as customers complained they weren’t able to make payments using their bank cards at grocery stores and gas stations or use ATMs. Both said they were able to restore services hours later.\n\nSouthern African regional airline Airlink also reported that its IT network and telephone lines were down because of what it called a global network outage, but said flights were not affected.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/19/cloudstrike-microsoft-massive-it-outage-not-cyberattack-security-incident-latest/\n\nSource 5:\nMany hospitals and labs across the U.S. and globally have had their systems shut down, leading some hospitals to cancel or delay procedures and surgeries. Medical staff at many facilities have had to revert to documenting everything via pen and paper and calling in prescriptions. \n\nBoston-based Brigham and Women\'s Hospital canceled <https://x.com/BrighamWomens/status/1814270590141768016https://x.com/BrighamWomens/status/1814270590141768016> all previously scheduled non-urgent surgeries, procedures, and medical visits. Cone Health, a health-care network in North Carolina, canceled treatments, procedures, and surgeries. Corewell Health, a Michigan-based health care system, issued an alert to customers that many of its computers had been impacted and that procedures and appointments could be delayed. Even labs like Labcorp said the outage impacted their ability to deliver lab results to physicians and patients—which could potentially result in delays for hospital discharges or admissions as well as treatment.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/19/crowdstrike-outage-glitch-hospitals-healthcare-doctors-computer-systems/\n\nSource 5:\nDr. Kabir recalled a cyberattack at the private hospital where he was working a year ago that also forced doctors and nurses to revert to updating patient records in writing. At the time, Dr. Kabir said cardiologists were unable to review electrocardiograms, the critical tests that measure electrical activity of the heart. "I’d say most people have done it at least one or two times,” he said.\n\nIronically, hospitals and clinics are using companies like CrowdStrike specifically to avoid these sorts of shutdowns and bolster the safety of the often outdated tech systems they rely on. The CrowdStrike episode has underscored that system shutdowns may be unavoidable.\n\nThe healthcare industry is just one of many industry\'s slammed by the outage. The glitch has shaken the entire global economy—impacting everything from airlines to television stations to government agencies. “My morning started with a 4 a.m. call from the Situation Room to highlight the issue that occurred with CrowdStrike,” Anne Neuberger, Deputy Assistant to President Biden and Deputy National Security Advisor for cyber and emerging technologies, said on stage this morning at the Aspen Security Forum, when asked about the outage.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/19/crowdstrike-outage-glitch-hospitals-healthcare-doctors-computer-systems/\n\nSource 6:\nSeveral adversarial nations have been known to use false (spoofed) GPS signals to interfere with air transit <https://australianaviation.com.au/2023/03/qantas-pilots-subject-to-gps-jamming-from-chinese-warships/>, shipping <https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1148748/War-zone-GPS-jamming-sees-more-ships-show-up-at-airports>, and trade <https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/11/15/131940/ghost-ships-crop-circles-and-soft-gold-a-gps-mystery-in-shanghai/>, or to disrupt military logistics in conflict zones.

In 2017, a series of errors within Amazon <https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/>.com Inc.’s cloud service affected <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/amazon-web-services-reports-high-error-rates-with-data-storage> the operation of tens of thousands of websites.

Shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products and agricultural goods would be hit hard, he said, especially with harvest season looming.\n\nBoth railroads have extensive networks in the U.S., and CPKC also serves Mexico. Those operations will keep running even if there is a work stoppage.\n\nCPKC said it remains committed to avoiding a work stoppage that would damage Canada\'s economy and international reputation. “However we must take responsible and prudent steps to prepare for a potential rail service interruption next week,” spokesman Patrick Waldron said in a statement.\n\nShutting down the network will allow the railroad to get dangerous goods off of its network before any stoppage, CPKC said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/17/us-supply-chains-canada-railroad-networks-shutdown-networks-labor-union-dispute/'}

2024-11-08 06:39:57,552: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If the internet were to shut down for a day, the effects would be far-reaching and multifaceted. For one, it would severely disrupt global communication, commerce, and transportation. A recent example of this was seen when a major internet outage affecting Microsoft disrupted flights, banks, media outlets, and companies across the world [4]. Airlines and airports in the United States, Europe, Australia, India, and elsewhere reported problems, with some flights grounded [4]. This kind of disruption would be amplified if the entire internet were to shut down.

The impact on the economy would also be significant. A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion

For one, it would severely disrupt global communication, commerce, and transportation. A recent example of this was seen when a major internet outage affecting Microsoft disrupted flights, banks, media outlets, and companies across the world [4]. Airlines and airports in the United States, Europe, Australia, India, and elsewhere reported problems, with some flights grounded [4]. This kind of disruption would be amplified if the entire internet were to shut down.

The impact on the economy would also be significant. A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8].

2024-11-08 06:39:58,503: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If the internet were to shut down for a day, the effects would be far-reaching and multifaceted. For one, it would severely disrupt global communication, commerce, and transportation. A recent example of this was seen when a major internet outage affecting Microsoft disrupted flights, banks, media outlets, and companies across the world [4]. Airlines and airports in the United States, Europe, Australia, India, and elsewhere reported problems, with some flights grounded [4]. This kind of disruption would be amplified if the entire internet were to shut down.

The impact on the economy would also be significant. A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8]. Similarly, a global internet shutdown would affect the entire global economy, causing widespread disruptions to supply chains, financial transactions

2024-11-08 06:39:58,775: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If the internet were to shut down for a day, the effects would be far-reaching and multifaceted. For one, it would severely disrupt global communication, commerce, and transportation. A recent example of this was seen when a major internet outage affecting Microsoft disrupted flights, banks, media outlets, and companies across the world [4]. Airlines and airports in the United States, Europe, Australia, India, and elsewhere reported problems, with some flights grounded [4]. This kind of disruption would be amplified if the entire internet were to shut down.

The impact on the economy would also be significant. A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8]. Similarly, a global internet shutdown would affect the entire global economy, causing widespread disruptions to supply chains, financial transactions, and other critical systems.

2024-11-08 06:39:59,036: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If the internet were to shut down for a day, the effects would be far-reaching and multifaceted. For one, it would severely disrupt global communication, commerce, and transportation. A recent example of this was seen when a major internet outage affecting Microsoft disrupted flights, banks, media outlets, and companies across the world [4]. Airlines and airports in the United States, Europe, Australia, India, and elsewhere reported problems, with some flights grounded [4]. This kind of disruption would be amplified if the entire internet were to shut down.

The impact on the economy would also be significant. A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8]. Similarly, a global internet shutdown would affect the entire global economy, causing widespread disruptions to supply chains, financial transactions, and other critical systems.

A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8]. Similarly, a global internet shutdown would affect the entire global economy, causing widespread disruptions to supply chains, financial transactions, and other critical systems. As Troy Hunt, an Australian security consultant, noted, "I don’t think it’s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history" [7].

A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8]. Similarly, a global internet shutdown would affect the entire global economy, causing widespread disruptions to supply chains, financial transactions, and other critical systems. As Troy Hunt, an Australian security consultant, noted, "I don’t think it’s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history" [7].

2024-11-08 06:39:59,762: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If the internet were to shut down for a day, the effects would be far-reaching and multifaceted. For one, it would severely disrupt global communication, commerce, and transportation. A recent example of this was seen when a major internet outage affecting Microsoft disrupted flights, banks, media outlets, and companies across the world [4]. Airlines and airports in the United States, Europe, Australia, India, and elsewhere reported problems, with some flights grounded [4]. This kind of disruption would be amplified if the entire internet were to shut down.

The impact on the economy would also be significant. A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8]. Similarly, a global internet shutdown would affect the entire global economy, causing widespread disruptions to supply chains, financial transactions, and other critical systems. As Troy Hunt, an Australian security consultant, noted, "I don’t think it’s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history" [7].

In addition to the economic and logistical disruptions, a global internet shutdown would also have significant social and cultural implications. With people increasingly reliant on the internet for communication,

In addition to the economic and logistical disruptions, a global internet shutdown would also have significant social and cultural implications.

2024-11-08 06:40:00,060: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If the internet were to shut down for a day, the effects would be far-reaching and multifaceted. For one, it would severely disrupt global communication, commerce, and transportation. A recent example of this was seen when a major internet outage affecting Microsoft disrupted flights, banks, media outlets, and companies across the world [4]. Airlines and airports in the United States, Europe, Australia, India, and elsewhere reported problems, with some flights grounded [4]. This kind of disruption would be amplified if the entire internet were to shut down.

The impact on the economy would also be significant. A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8]. Similarly, a global internet shutdown would affect the entire global economy, causing widespread disruptions to supply chains, financial transactions, and other critical systems. As Troy Hunt, an Australian security consultant, noted, "I don’t think it’s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history" [7].

2024-11-08 06:40:00,218: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If the internet were to shut down for a day, the effects would be far-reaching and multifaceted. For one, it would severely disrupt global communication, commerce, and transportation. A recent example of this was seen when a major internet outage affecting Microsoft disrupted flights, banks, media outlets, and companies across the world [4]. Airlines and airports in the United States, Europe, Australia, India, and elsewhere reported problems, with some flights grounded [4]. This kind of disruption would be amplified if the entire internet were to shut down.

The impact on the economy would also be significant. A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8]. Similarly, a global internet shutdown would affect the entire global economy, causing widespread disruptions to supply chains, financial transactions, and other critical systems. As Troy Hunt, an Australian security consultant, noted, "I don’t think it’s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history" [7].

In addition to the economic and logistical disruptions, a global internet shutdown would also have significant social and cultural implications. With people increasingly reliant on the internet for communication, entertainment, and information, a shutdown would leave many feeling disconnected and isolated. As Alex Turvy, a researcher

For one, it would severely disrupt global communication, commerce, and transportation. A recent example of this was seen when a major internet outage affecting Microsoft disrupted flights, banks, media outlets, and companies across the world [4]. Airlines and airports in the United States, Europe, Australia, India, and elsewhere reported problems, with some flights grounded [4]. This kind of disruption would be amplified if the entire internet were to shut down.

The impact on the economy would also be significant. A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8]. Similarly, a global internet shutdown would affect the entire global economy, causing widespread disruptions to supply chains, financial transactions, and other critical systems. As Troy Hunt, an Australian security consultant, noted, "I don’t think it’s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history" [7].

In addition to the economic and logistical disruptions, a global internet shutdown would also have significant social and cultural implications. With people increasingly reliant on the internet for communication, entertainment, and information, a shutdown would leave many feeling disconnected and isolated. As Alex Turvy, a researcher studying social media and internet culture, notes,

A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8]. Similarly, a global internet shutdown would affect the entire global economy, causing widespread disruptions to supply chains, financial transactions, and other critical systems. As Troy Hunt, an Australian security consultant, noted, "I don’t think it’s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history" [7].

In addition to the economic and logistical disruptions, a global internet shutdown would also have significant social and cultural implications. With people increasingly reliant on the internet for communication, entertainment, and information, a shutdown would leave many feeling disconnected and isolated. As Alex Turvy, a researcher studying social media and internet culture, notes, "For most people, there’s

As Troy Hunt, an Australian security consultant, noted, "I don’t think it’s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history" [7].

In addition to the economic and logistical disruptions, a global internet shutdown would also have significant social and cultural implications. With people increasingly reliant on the internet for communication, entertainment, and information, a shutdown would leave many feeling disconnected and isolated. As Alex Turvy, a researcher studying social media and internet culture, notes, "For most people, there’s a need to stay close to their devices in order to be

A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8]. Similarly, a global internet shutdown would affect the entire global economy, causing widespread disruptions to supply chains, financial transactions, and other critical systems. As Troy Hunt, an Australian security consultant, noted, "I don’t think it’s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history" [7].

In addition to the economic and logistical disruptions, a global internet shutdown would also have significant social and cultural implications. With people increasingly reliant on the internet for communication, entertainment, and information, a shutdown would leave many feeling disconnected and isolated. As Alex Turvy, a researcher studying social media and internet culture, notes, "For most people, there’s a need to stay close to their devices in order to be available to their manager and colleagues, and

A recent example of this was seen when a major internet outage affecting Microsoft disrupted flights, banks, media outlets, and companies across the world [4]. Airlines and airports in the United States, Europe, Australia, India, and elsewhere reported problems, with some flights grounded [4]. This kind of disruption would be amplified if the entire internet were to shut down.

The impact on the economy would also be significant. A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8]. Similarly, a global internet shutdown would affect the entire global economy, causing widespread disruptions to supply chains, financial transactions, and other critical systems. As Troy Hunt, an Australian security consultant, noted, "I don’t think it’s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history" [7].

In addition to the economic and logistical disruptions, a global internet shutdown would also have significant social and cultural implications. With people increasingly reliant on the internet for communication, entertainment, and information, a shutdown would leave many feeling disconnected and isolated. As Alex Turvy, a researcher studying social media and internet culture, notes, "For most people, there’s a need to stay close to their devices in order to be available to their manager and colleagues, and in order to manage their family life" [1].

2024-11-08 06:40:01,012: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What would happen if the internet shut down for a day?

2024-11-08 06:40:01,013: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If the internet were to shut down for a day, the effects would be far-reaching and multifaceted. For one, it would severely disrupt global communication, commerce, and transportation. A recent example of this was seen when a major internet outage affecting Microsoft disrupted flights, banks, media outlets, and companies across the world [4]. Airlines and airports in the United States, Europe, Australia, India, and elsewhere reported problems, with some flights grounded [4]. This kind of disruption would be amplified if the entire internet were to shut down.

The impact on the economy would also be significant. A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8]. Similarly, a global internet shutdown would affect the entire global economy, causing widespread disruptions to supply chains, financial transactions, and other critical systems. As Troy Hunt, an Australian security consultant, noted, "I don’t think it’s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history" [7].

In addition to the economic and logistical disruptions, a global internet shutdown would also have significant social and cultural implications. With people increasingly reliant on the internet for communication, entertainment, and information, a shutdown would leave many feeling disconnected and isolated. As Alex Turvy, a researcher studying social media and internet culture, notes, "For most people, there’s a need to stay close to their devices in order to be available to their manager and colleagues, and in order to manage their family life" [1]. A shutdown would force people to adapt to new ways

A shutdown of the Canadian rail network, which handles about 40,000 carloads of freight each day, worth about $1 billion, would have a substantial impact on the economy, particularly on shipments of fully built automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, forestry products, and agricultural goods [8]. Similarly, a global internet shutdown would affect the entire global economy, causing widespread disruptions to supply chains, financial transactions, and other critical systems. As Troy Hunt, an Australian security consultant, noted, "I don’t think it’s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history" [7].

In addition to the economic and logistical disruptions, a global internet shutdown would also have significant social and cultural implications. With people increasingly reliant on the internet for communication, entertainment, and information, a shutdown would leave many feeling disconnected and isolated. As Alex Turvy, a researcher studying social media and internet culture, notes, "For most people, there’s a need to stay close to their devices in order to be available to their manager and colleagues, and in order to manage their family life" [1]. A shutdown would force people to adapt to new ways of communicating and interacting, at least for a day.
