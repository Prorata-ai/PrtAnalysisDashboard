Amid limited investment options in China, the protracted crisis in its property sector, volatile stock markets and a weakening yuan are all driving money to assets that are perceived to be safer. \n\n“The weight of money available under these circumstances for an asset like gold - and actually for new buyers to come in - is pretty considerable,” he said. “There isn’t much alternative in China. With exchange controls and capital controls, you can’t just look at other markets to put your money into.”\n\nAlthough China mines more gold than any other country, it still needs to import a lot and the quantities are getting larger. In the last two years, overseas purchases totaled over 2,800 tons — more than all of the metal that backs exchange-traded funds around the world, or about a third of the stockpiles held by the US Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the pace of shipments has accelerated lately.

Recent gains for the precious metal are largely credited to ongoing economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and strong demand from central banks around the world.\n\nIf trends continue, analysts have bullish outlooks on the price of gold for the months ahead. But the future is never promised. Here\'s what you need to know.\n\nWhere does the price of gold stand today?\n\nThe New York spot price of gold <https://fortune.com/recommends/investing/best-gold-ira-companies/> closed Tuesday at just over $2,657 per Troy ounce — the standard for measuring precious metals, which is equivalent <https://apnews.com/article/poland-gold-war-russia-ukraine-a496027aa181ca0a1fdb756965f369b0> to 31 grams — the highest recorded to date, per FactSet. That would make a gold bar or brick weighing 400 Troy ounces worth more than $1.06 million today.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/25/gold-prices-investing/\n\nSource 1:\nThis week\'s record high means that the price of gold has climbed hundreds of dollars per Troy ounce over the last year. Tuesday\'s price is up nearly $145 from a month ago and more than $740 from this time in 2023.\n\nThe price of gold is up nearly 30% year to date, analysts note — outpacing the benchmark S&P 500\'s roughly 20% gain since the start of 2024.\n\nWhy is the price of gold going up?\n\nThere are a few factors behind the recent gains.\n\nInterest in buying gold <https://apnews.com/article/costco-gold-bars-demand-precious-metal-investment-5ea90e851227803968856e299e721fd5> often comes at times of uncertainty — with potential concerns around inflation and the strength of the U.S. dollar, for example, causing some to look for alternative places to park their money. Gold also surged <https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-ap-top-news-financial-markets-business-prices-db3bcf10ddcf6e0a6dc0f313ec4d6fd7> in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/25/gold-prices-investing/\n\nSource 1:\nAnalysts also point to strong demand from central banks around the world. Joe Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, noted last month that central bank demand was well-above the five year average — reflecting "heightened concern with inflation and economic stability.”\n\nRecent stimulus measures in China <https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-banks-rates-pboc-642053f11cbb9cfa2ca57b38593ce7f8> aimed at boosting consumer spending are also expected to up retail investments, Saliby added, further boosting gold\'s performance.\n\nIs gold worth the investment?\n\nAdvocates of investing in gold <https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-changing-economy-financial-markets-business-inflation-18a7da6836e29486ab94d3ab93fd14ac> call it a “safe haven,” arguing the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road.

With exchange controls and capital controls, you can’t just look at other markets to put your money into.”\n\nAlthough China mines more gold than any other country, it still needs to import a lot and the quantities are getting larger. In the last two years, overseas purchases totaled over 2,800 tons — more than all of the metal that backs exchange-traded funds around the world, or about a third of the stockpiles held by the US Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the pace of shipments has accelerated lately.
