Last November, worldwide opinion applauded its diplomacy toward Moscow and Peking and its withdrawal of the U.S. from the Vietnam war. At home the more raucous and violent expressions of dissent had abated. The economy was on a steep upgrade. The voters were ready to give Nixon one of the most resounding victories in the U.S. electoral record. Now, Nixon's Administration has lost diplomatic momentum, and its initiatives in domestic affairs have become fitful and feeble. Many key men of the 1972 Nixon ascendancy have departed, some in disgrace and some in disgust. So low has the Nixon political estate sunk that Spiro Agnew's resignation may be viewed by the White House either as one more affliction of a Job-like President or as a respite that distracts attention from pressures nearer home.

There remains 13,111 Bitcoin in the wallet, worth around $759 million at the time of publication. This means about 75% of the seized assets have been sold off so far.\n\nThe prospect of $2.1 billion of Bitcoin entering the market may have spooked some investors as Germany's sales have coincided with recent price corrections. Bitcoin's latest decline began on June 6, according to CoinGecko data, aligning with when the BKA outflows began to accelerate.

Sheltered by tariffs and other protective devices from the invigorating effects of competition, industry had neither the Incentive nor the opportunity to develop its true potential.

Sheltered by tariffs and other protective devices from the invigorating effects of competition, industry had neither the Incentive nor the opportunity to develop its true potential.

At home the more raucous and violent expressions of dissent had abated. The economy was on a steep upgrade. The voters were ready to give Nixon one of the most resounding victories in the U.S. electoral record. Now, Nixon's Administration has lost diplomatic momentum, and its initiatives in domestic affairs have become fitful and feeble. Many key men of the 1972 Nixon ascendancy have departed, some in disgrace and some in disgust. So low has the Nixon political estate sunk that Spiro Agnew's resignation may be viewed by the White House either as one more affliction of a Job-like President or as a respite that distracts attention from pressures nearer home.

And the further you look back in time, the more interesting those shifts become.\n\nWhen Fortune published the first list with the title “Global 500” in 1990, West and East Germany were still two separate nations. China, now regularly in competition with the U.S. for the highest total number of Global 500 companies, was not even among the top 10 countries in 1990 by that measure. There were 167 U.S. companies on the 1990 list, 111 Japanese companies, and in a distant third was Britain, with 43.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/13/1990-1995-global-500-us-japan-mitsubishi-automakers/\n\nSource 12:\nTo understand what has happened, it is necessary to consider why this highly developed and eminently civilized continent, where modern industrialism got its start, found itself far behind the U.S. There never was any conclusive evidence that Europeans were less energetic or technically ingenious. But what they did lack was a continental mass market that would enable their production and distribution to take full advantage of the great technological developments of the twentieth century. Even before World War I, Europe's pace was lagging behind that of the U.S. because economic nationalism divided the Continent into cramped compartments, within which large-scale production was severely inhibited if not prevented. Sheltered by tariffs and other protective devices from the invigorating effects of competition, industry had neither the Incentive nor the opportunity to develop its true potential. This became possible only when six nations took the bold, history-making decision in the 1957 Treaty of Rome to tear down the compartment walls and form a European Economic Community. The country that surprised everybody The idea of the Common Market has taken effect well in advance of the formal technical arrangements. The reduction of tariffs between the six Common Market countries is well ahead of schedule, but they are still at 50 percent of their former levels, and a number of other, more subtle trade restrictions remain\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/old-europes-young-again-and-fretting-fortune-classics-1963/"}

Last November, worldwide opinion applauded its diplomacy toward Moscow and Peking and its withdrawal of the U.S. from the Vietnam war. At home the more raucous and violent expressions of dissent had abated. The economy was on a steep upgrade. The voters were ready to give Nixon one of the most resounding victories in the U.S. electoral record. Now, Nixon's Administration has lost diplomatic momentum, and its initiatives in domestic affairs have become fitful and feeble. Many key men of the 1972 Nixon ascendancy have departed, some in disgrace and some in disgust. So low has the Nixon political estate sunk that Spiro Agnew's resignation may be viewed by the White House either as one more affliction of a Job-like President or as a respite that distracts attention from pressures nearer home. The errant thread that, when pulled, unraveled Nixon's skein of triumph was, of course, Watergate, the weird sequence beginning in the summer of 1971 before the break-in at the psychiatrist's office and running on and on through the slow disintegration of the cover-up in 1973.

Last November, worldwide opinion applauded its diplomacy toward Moscow and Peking and its withdrawal of the U.S. from the Vietnam war. At home the more raucous and violent expressions of dissent had abated. The economy was on a steep upgrade. The voters were ready to give Nixon one of the most resounding victories in the U.S. electoral record. Now, Nixon's Administration has lost diplomatic momentum, and its initiatives in domestic affairs have become fitful and feeble. Many key men of the 1972 Nixon ascendancy have departed, some in disgrace and some in disgust. So low has the Nixon political estate sunk that Spiro Agnew's resignation may be viewed by the White House either as one more affliction of a Job-like President or as a respite that distracts attention from pressures nearer home. The errant thread that, when pulled, unraveled Nixon's skein of triumph was, of course, Watergate, the weird sequence beginning in the summer of 1971 before the break-in at the psychiatrist's office and running on and on through the slow disintegration of the cover-up in 1973.

China, now regularly in competition with the U.S. for the highest total number of Global 500 companies, was not even among the top 10 countries in 1990 by that measure. There were 167 U.S. companies on the 1990 list, 111 Japanese companies, and in a distant third was Britain, with 43.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/13/1990-1995-global-500-us-japan-mitsubishi-automakers/\n\nSource 12:\nTo understand what has happened, it is necessary to consider why this highly developed and eminently civilized continent, where modern industrialism got its start, found itself far behind the U.S. There never was any conclusive evidence that Europeans were less energetic or technically ingenious. But what they did lack was a continental mass market that would enable their production and distribution to take full advantage of the great technological developments of the twentieth century. Even before World War I, Europe's pace was lagging behind that of the U.S. because economic nationalism divided the Continent into cramped compartments, within which large-scale production was severely inhibited if not prevented. Sheltered by tariffs and other protective devices from the invigorating effects of competition, industry had neither the Incentive nor the opportunity to develop its true potential. This became possible only when six nations took the bold, history-making decision in the 1957 Treaty of Rome to tear down the compartment walls and form a European Economic Community.
