It’s true—sleep is an essential part of maintaining overall well-being. When you are well rested, your mood improves, your stress levels decrease, and you tend to feel more productive. \n\nBeyond <https://fortune.com/company/overstock-com/> quantity of sleep, research has shown that the quality <https://fortune.com/well/2023/03/03/sleep-diet-exercise-goals/> of your sleep matters too. While current guidelines recommend adults get between seven and nine hours <https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html> of sleep, over a third of Americans do not meet the minimum. It’s too easy to give in to the over-stimulating activities at your fingertips—hello, TikTok—instead of turning the lights off. Minutes scrolling on social media before bed turn into hours, and screens have made it harder to shut off the brain and prepare for a good night’s rest—ever heard of revenge bedtime procrastination <https://fortune.com/well/2022/08/25/how-to-stop-revenge-bedtime-procrastination/>?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/28/guide-to-better-sleep/\n\nSource 2:\nGetting little sleep is associated with an increased risk of chronic health conditions like heart disease and stroke.

So, improving sleep can, in turn, improve our lives. Even following certain sleep habits <https://fortune.com/well/2023/02/23/healthy-sleep-habits-for-aging/> can increase your life expectancy, per one study. \n\nSleep basics\n\nHow much sleep do I need? \n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adults need at least seven hours of sleep. For those 65 and older, the CDC recommends between seven and eight hours of sleep each night. \n\nWhy is it harder to sleep for older adults?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/28/guide-to-better-sleep/\n\nSource 3:\nKey takeaways\n\n * Seven to nine hours of sleep per night can help with health and fitness goals \n * Quality of sleep determined by six factors: regularity, satisfaction, alertness, timing, efficiency and duration \n * Sleep is closely tied to cardiovascular health \nBetter sleep may be the solution for everything from adding years to your life <https://fortune.com/well/2023/02/23/healthy-sleep-habits-for-aging/> to better health and wellness. According to research presented at the American Heart Association’s Epidemiology, Prevention, Lifestyle & Cardiometabolic Health Scientific Sessions 2023 <https://professional.heart.org/en/meetings/epi-lifestyle> in Boston earlier this week, people who reported regular, uninterrupted sleep were better at sticking to exercise and diet plans while trying to lose weight.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/2023/03/03/sleep-diet-exercise-goals/\n\nSource 3:\n“Focusing on obtaining good sleep—seven to nine hours at night with a regular wake time along with waking refreshed and being alert throughout the day—may be an important behavior that helps people stick with their physical activity and dietary modification goals,” said Christopher E. Kline, Ph.D., an associate professor in the department of health and human development at the University of Pittsburgh, in a press release <https://newsroom.heart.org/news/a-good-nights-sleep-may-make-it-easier-to-stick-to-exercise-and-diet-goals-study-found?preview=a943> about the study. “A previous study of ours reported that better sleep health was associated with a significantly greater loss of body weight and fat among participants in a year-long, behavioral weight loss program <https://fortune.com/recommends/health/best-weight-loss-program/>.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/2023/03/03/sleep-diet-exercise-goals/\n\nSource 4:\n“Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep their benefits are greatly reduced,” Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director, Indiana Sleep Center, expert at SleepFoundation.org <https://www.sleepfoundation.org/>, and coauthor of Sleep to Heal: 7 Simple Steps to Better Sleep <https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Heal-Refresh-Restore-Revitalize/dp/1630062340/ref=sr_1_1?crid=222HN5DUONGAM&keywords=sleep+to+heal&qid=1677545988&sprefix=sleep+to+heal%2Caps%2C123&sr=8-1>, previously told Fortune. “Sleep is important for metabolic health, immune health, muscle repair, optimal brain function, and mental health.

When you sleep, your body performs work that supports healthy brain function and physical health. And for children and teens, getting enough sleep aids healthy growth and development.\n\nAdequate sleep supports the following body functions, the CDC says:\n\n * Heart and circulatory system: People who don’t sleep enough or wake up often may have a higher risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and/or stroke.\n\n * Metabolism: Not getting enough quality shut eye may lead to insulin resistance, increased eating (especially of unhealthy foods), and decreased physical activity, all of which contribute to obesity, which carries its own health risks.\n\n * Immune systems: A particular type of immune cell works harder when you sleep.

2024-11-08 06:45:51,415: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night

2024-11-08 06:45:51,589: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health

2024-11-08 06:45:51,776: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2].

2024-11-08 06:45:51,958: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2].

2024-11-08 06:45:52,845: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2].

2024-11-08 06:45:52,975: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built.

2024-11-08 06:45:53,169: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2].

During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

2024-11-08 06:45:53,697: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

2024-11-08 06:45:53,941: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2].

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less

In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

2024-11-08 06:45:54,595: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

2024-11-08 06:45:54,730: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease

2024-11-08 06:45:54,910: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3].

2024-11-08 06:45:55,946: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep has been linked to a range

2024-11-08 06:45:56,159: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep has been linked to a range of health benefits, including improved physical and

2024-11-08 06:45:56,655: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3].

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep has been linked to a range of health benefits, including improved physical and mental health, better cognitive function, and a reduced risk of chronic

2024-11-08 06:45:57,278: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep has been linked to a range of health benefits, including improved physical and mental health, better cognitive function, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases [1, 3

2024-11-08 06:45:57,293: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep has been linked to a range of health benefits, including improved physical and mental health, better cognitive function, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases [1, 3].

Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep has been linked to a range of health benefits, including improved physical and mental health, better cognitive function, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases [1, 3].

2024-11-08 06:45:57,592: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep has been linked to a range of health benefits, including improved physical and mental health, better cognitive function, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases [1, 3].

2024-11-08 06:45:57,690: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep has been linked to a range of health benefits, including improved physical and mental health, better cognitive function, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases [1, 3].

2024-11-08 06:45:57,841: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep has been linked to a range of health benefits, including improved physical and mental health, better cognitive function, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases [1, 3].

2024-11-08 06:45:59,631: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep has been linked to a range of health benefits, including improved physical and mental health, better cognitive function, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases [1, 3]. As Christopher E. Kline, Ph.D., notes, "Focusing on obtaining good sleep...may be an important behavior that helps people

2024-11-08 06:45:59,692: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep has been linked to a range of health benefits, including improved physical and mental health, better cognitive function, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases [1, 3]. As Christopher E. Kline, Ph.D., notes, "Focusing on obtaining good sleep...may be an important behavior that helps people stick with their physical

2024-11-08 06:45:59,867: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep has been linked to a range of health benefits, including improved physical and mental health, better cognitive function, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases [1, 3]. As Christopher E. Kline, Ph.D., notes, "Focusing on obtaining good sleep...may be an important behavior that helps people stick with their physical activity and dietary modification goals"

2024-11-08 06:45:59,978: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why is sleep important for overall health?

2024-11-08 06:45:59,978: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Sleep is essential for overall health, and research has consistently shown that it plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sleep is important for healthy brain function and physical health [6]. During sleep, the body performs various functions that support overall health, including the repair and regeneration of damaged cells, the building of bone and muscle, and the strengthening of the immune system [6]. Additionally, sleep helps to support the heart and circulatory system, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke [6].

Sleep is also crucial for cognitive function, with research showing that it aids in learning and forming long-term memories [6]. Furthermore, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, with studies suggesting that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety [1]. In fact, one study found that older adults who get five or fewer hours of sleep per night are at risk for developing multiple chronic conditions, including mental health problems like anxiety and depression [2]. As Dr. Abhinav Singh, medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center, notes, "Quality sleep is the foundation on which optimal health is built. Even if nutrition and exercise are at their best, without proper sleep, their benefits are greatly reduced" [4].

In terms of the amount of sleep needed, the CDC recommends that adults aim for seven to nine hours per night [2]. Research has shown that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night can have negative consequences for overall health, including an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke [3]. On the other hand, getting adequate sleep has been linked to a range of health benefits, including improved physical and mental health, better cognitive function, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases [1, 3]. As Christopher E. Kline, Ph.D., notes, "Focusing on obtaining good sleep...may be an important behavior that helps people stick with their physical activity and dietary modification goals" [3].
