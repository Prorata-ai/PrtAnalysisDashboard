It was at the University of Toronto where he reached a major breakthrough that would become the intellectual foundation for many contemporary uses of AI. In 2012, Hinton and two grad students (one of whom was Ilya Sutskever, the former chief scientist <https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/openai-sam-altman-geoffrey-hinton-nobel-prize-physics-ilya-sutskever-toronto/> at OpenAI) built a neural network that could identify basic objects in pictures.

Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don’t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse. It will boost fraud, cybercrime, and misinformation. It will erode societal trust and hurt democracy. AI could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. All of these risks are present with AI technology that exists today. There is also a remote—but not completely nonexistent—chance that a superintelligent AI system could pose an existential risk to humanity.

Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don’t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse.

In a Shakespearean twist, they’ll have learned how to do so precisely from our own flaws. \n\n“They will be able to manipulate people,” Hinton told 60 Minutes in October 2023. “They will be very good at convincing people, because they’ll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they’ll know all that stuff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/\n\nSource 2:\nMuch of Hinton’s worry stems from the belief that humanity knows frighteningly little about artificial intelligence—and that machines may outsmart humans. “These things could get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over, and we need to worry now about how we prevent that happening,” he said <https://www.npr.org/2023/05/28/1178673070/the-godfather-of-ai-sounds-alarm-about-potential-dangers-of-ai> in an interview with NPR.\nOriginally from England, Hinton spent much of his professional life in the U.S. and Canada. It was at the University of Toronto where he reached a major breakthrough that would become the intellectual foundation for many contemporary uses of AI. In 2012, Hinton and two grad students (one of whom was Ilya Sutskever, the former chief scientist <https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/openai-sam-altman-geoffrey-hinton-nobel-prize-physics-ilya-sutskever-toronto/> at OpenAI) built a neural network that could identify basic objects in pictures. Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> eventually bought <https://www.wired.com/story/secret-auction-race-ai-supremacy-google-microsoft-baidu/> a company Hinton had started based on the tech for $44 million. Hinton then worked at Google for 10 years before retiring in 2023 to free himself from any corporate constraints that may have limited his ability to warn the public about AI.

And regulation is, for the moment, lacking. This should scare us. For all its opportunities, AI presents grave dangers too. In Mastering AI, I detail many of these risks, some of which have not received the attention they deserve. Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don’t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse. It will boost fraud, cybercrime, and misinformation. It will erode societal trust and hurt democracy. AI could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. All of these risks are present with AI technology that exists today. There is also a remote—but not completely nonexistent—chance that a superintelligent AI system could pose an existential risk to humanity. It would be wise to devote some effort to taking this last risk off the table, but we should not let these efforts distract or crowd out work we need to do to solve AI’s more immediate\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/09/mastering-ai-jeremy-kahn-book-ai-risks-eye-on-ai/\n\nSource 5:\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman says artificial intelligence could become smarter than humans sooner than many people expect.\n\nIn a blog post on his personal site <https://ia.samaltman.com/>, Altman discussed what he’s calling the Intelligence Age and said “It is possible that we will have superintelligence <https://fortune.com/2023/07/18/elon-musk-xai-sam-altman-openai-artificial-superintelligence/> in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I’m confident we’ll get there.”\n\nOf course, “thousands” of days is pretty open-ended. 2,000 days is 5.5 years, while 5,000 days is just shy of 14, so while Altman is incredibly bullish on AI’s future, he’s not predicting overnight changes.\n\nWhereas generative AI’s goal is to match the intellectual capabilities of humans, superintelligent AI looks to go even further, perhaps vastly outpacing the human brain’s ability to assess problems and arrive at decisions. It’s a technology that can stoke some of the biggest fears about AI given its potential.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/sam-altman-ai-superintelligence/\n\nSource 6:\nThe development of AI should come with ethical norms for engineers, similar to those that apply to doctors or lawyers, the scientists argue.

Overestimating the near term, underestimating the long term, Gartner’s latest “Hype Cycle for Artificial Intelligence” <https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5505695#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20(GenAI)%20has%20passed,standardized%20processes%20to%20aid%20implementation.> report already has us mired in disillusionment about cloud AI services.\nAnd yet, as my colleague Jeremy Kahn writes so eloquently in his new book, Mastering AI <https://www.masteringaibook.com/>, we’re clearly on the precipice of having our lives transformed by technology that can heighten or threaten the essence of who we are. As he told Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell at his book launch in New York last night, humans have long harnessed the power of animals and technologies that exceed our physical power. "We never really defined ourselves as a species based on brawn,” he said. AI, on the other hand, “challenges what makes us unique as a species, which is really our intelligence.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/10/outsourcing-our-writing-to-chatgpt-may-diminish-our-critical-thinking/\n\nSource 8:\nAI experts such as Geoffrey Hinton <https://fortune.com/2023/05/01/godfather-ai-geoffrey-hinton-quit-google-regrets-lifes-work-bad-actors/> fear Silicon Valley executives won’t stop at just AGI: Mankind could ultimately create an artificial superintelligence (ASI).\n\nThis ASI would not just mimic human learning processes like current transformer-based neural networks such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, but could potentially gain self-awareness in the process—relegating humanity to the second-most advanced species on earth.\n\nWith so much riding on Altman’s ability to make the responsible decision, Emanuel fears past behavior suggests he can’t be trusted <https://fortune.com/2024/03/08/sam-altman-confirms-return-to-openai-board-as-law-firms-review-rips-loss-of-trust-that-led-to-his-sudden-ouster/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks> to properly develop groundbreaking technology—especially given a growing chorus of critics.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/chatgpt-openai-sam-altman-microsoft-ari-emanuel-endeavor-aspen/\n\nSource 9:\nAnd of course, the prospect of artificial general intelligence (AGI) appeals to us after decades of Hollywood movies where machines become so capable that they battle it out with humans.\n\nAlas, it seems unlikely that anything of the scale promised by the tech world—such as rapid advances towards singularity where machines can do everything <https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/could-advanced-ai-drive-explosive-economic-growth/> humans can—is even remotely possible. Even more grounded predictions such as those from Goldman Sachs <https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html> that generative AI will boost global GDP by 7% over the next decade and from the McKinsey Global Institute <https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-AI-the-next-productivity-frontier#/> that the annual GDP growth rate could increase by 3-4 percentage points between now and 2040, may be far too optimistic.\n\nWhat should we expect from AI?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/mit-economist-markets-overestimated-ai-driven-productivity-gains/\n\nSource 10:\nProponents say AI could lead to utopia <https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-utopia-or-dystopia-venture-capitalist-vinod-khosla-bd6c037c>, where poverty is eliminated, mankind finds the cure <https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/19/1079261/czi-ai-cell-disease/> to every disease, and all work is done by machines, leaving humans to spend their days idly enjoying their time.

Silver is not himself a doomer, but neither does he dismiss their concerns. \n\n“To dismiss these concerns is ignorant,” Silver said in On the Edge. “Ignorant of the scientific consensus, ignorant of the parameters of the debate, ignorant and profoundly incurious about mankind’s urge, with no clear exceptions so far in human history, to push technological development to the edge.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/nate-silver-sam-bankman-fried-sam-altman-openai-ftx-ai/'}

It was at the University of Toronto where he reached a major breakthrough that would become the intellectual foundation for many contemporary uses of AI. In 2012, Hinton and two grad students (one of whom was Ilya Sutskever, the former chief scientist <https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/openai-sam-altman-geoffrey-hinton-nobel-prize-physics-ilya-sutskever-toronto/> at OpenAI) built a neural network that could identify basic objects in pictures. Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> eventually bought <https://www.wired.com/story/secret-auction-race-ai-supremacy-google-microsoft-baidu/> a company Hinton had started based on the tech for $44 million. Hinton then worked at Google for 10 years before retiring in 2023 to free himself from any corporate constraints that may have limited his ability to warn the public about AI. (Hinton did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/geoffrey-hinton-nobel-ai-pioneer-concerns/\n\nSource 3:\nClarke even touched on machine learning, what we’d now ubiquitously call AI <https://fortune.com/2024/05/29/saps-cfo-dominik-asam-ai-winner-takes-all-game-blackrock-bond-guru-rick-rieder-agrees/>: “The most intelligent inhabitants of that future world won\'t be men or monkeys,” he posited. “They\'ll be machines.” Echoing the wary comments of the so-called godfather of AI <https://fortune.com/2023/05/01/godfather-ai-geoffrey-hinton-quit-google-regrets-lifes-work-bad-actors/>, Geoffrey Hinton, Clarke said he expects machines to outsmart humans. “They will start to think, and eventually they will completely outthink their makers.

And regulation is, for the moment, lacking. This should scare us. For all its opportunities, AI presents grave dangers too. In Mastering AI, I detail many of these risks, some of which have not received the attention they deserve. Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don’t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse. It will boost fraud, cybercrime, and misinformation. It will erode societal trust and hurt democracy. AI could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. All of these risks are present with AI technology that exists today. There is also a remote—but not completely nonexistent—chance that a superintelligent AI system could pose an existential risk to humanity. It would be wise to devote some effort to taking this last risk off the table, but we should not let these efforts distract or crowd out work we need to do to solve AI’s more immediate\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/09/mastering-ai-jeremy-kahn-book-ai-risks-eye-on-ai/\n\nSource 5:\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman says artificial intelligence could become smarter than humans sooner than many people expect.\n\nIn a blog post on his personal site <https://ia.samaltman.com/>, Altman discussed what he’s calling the Intelligence Age and said “It is possible that we will have superintelligence <https://fortune.com/2023/07/18/elon-musk-xai-sam-altman-openai-artificial-superintelligence/> in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I’m confident we’ll get there.”\n\nOf course, “thousands” of days is pretty open-ended. 2,000 days is 5.5 years, while 5,000 days is just shy of 14, so while Altman is incredibly bullish on AI’s future, he’s not predicting overnight changes.\n\nWhereas generative AI’s goal is to match the intellectual capabilities of humans, superintelligent AI looks to go even further, perhaps vastly outpacing the human brain’s ability to assess problems and arrive at decisions. It’s a technology that can stoke some of the biggest fears about AI given its potential.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/sam-altman-ai-superintelligence/\n\nSource 6:\nThe development of AI should come with ethical norms for engineers, similar to those that apply to doctors or lawyers, the scientists argue. Governments should think of AI less as an exciting new technology, and more as a global public good. \n\n“Collectively, we must prepare to avert the attendant catastrophic risks that could arrive at any time,” the letter read.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/ai-humans-control-computer-scientists-warnings-regulations-governments/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/ai-humans-control-computer-scientists-warnings-regulations-governments/\n\nSource 7:\nGood morning. \n\nWe humans can get so emotional about AI—dazzled, afraid, frustrated, even disdainful that all those data centers and investment dollars have yet to shave hours off our workday.

And regulation is, for the moment, lacking. This should scare us. For all its opportunities, AI presents grave dangers too. In Mastering AI, I detail many of these risks, some of which have not received the attention they deserve. Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don’t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse. It will boost fraud, cybercrime, and misinformation. It will erode societal trust and hurt democracy. AI could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. All of these risks are present with AI technology that exists today. There is also a remote—but not completely nonexistent—chance that a superintelligent AI system could pose an existential risk to humanity. It would be wise to devote some effort to taking this last risk off the table, but we should not let these efforts distract or crowd out work we need to do to solve AI’s more immediate\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/09/mastering-ai-jeremy-kahn-book-ai-risks-eye-on-ai/\n\nSource 5:\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman says artificial intelligence could become smarter than humans sooner than many people expect.\n\nIn a blog post on his personal site <https://ia.samaltman.com/>, Altman discussed what he’s calling the Intelligence Age and said “It is possible that we will have superintelligence <https://fortune.com/2023/07/18/elon-musk-xai-sam-altman-openai-artificial-superintelligence/> in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I’m confident we’ll get there.”\n\nOf course, “thousands” of days is pretty open-ended. 2,000 days is 5.5 years, while 5,000 days is just shy of 14, so while Altman is incredibly bullish on AI’s future, he’s not predicting overnight changes.\n\nWhereas generative AI’s goal is to match the intellectual capabilities of humans, superintelligent AI looks to go even further, perhaps vastly outpacing the human brain’s ability to assess problems and arrive at decisions. It’s a technology that can stoke some of the biggest fears about AI given its potential.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/sam-altman-ai-superintelligence/\n\nSource 6:\nThe development of AI should come with ethical norms for engineers, similar to those that apply to doctors or lawyers, the scientists argue. Governments should think of AI less as an exciting new technology, and more as a global public good. \n\n“Collectively, we must prepare to avert the attendant catastrophic risks that could arrive at any time,” the letter read.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/ai-humans-control-computer-scientists-warnings-regulations-governments/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/ai-humans-control-computer-scientists-warnings-regulations-governments/\n\nSource 7:\nGood morning. \n\nWe humans can get so emotional about AI—dazzled, afraid, frustrated, even disdainful that all those data centers and investment dollars have yet to shave hours off our workday. Overestimating the near term, underestimating the long term, Gartner’s latest “Hype Cycle for Artificial Intelligence” <https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5505695#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20(GenAI)%20has%20passed,standardized%20processes%20to%20aid%20implementation.> report already has us mired in disillusionment about cloud AI services.\nAnd yet, as my colleague Jeremy Kahn writes so eloquently in his new book, Mastering AI <https://www.masteringaibook.com/>, we’re clearly on the precipice of having our lives transformed by technology that can heighten or threaten the essence of who we are. As he told Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell at his book launch in New York last night, humans have long harnessed the power of animals and technologies that exceed our physical power. "We never really defined ourselves as a species based on brawn,” he said. AI, on the other hand, “challenges what makes us unique as a species, which is really our intelligence.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/10/outsourcing-our-writing-to-chatgpt-may-diminish-our-critical-thinking/\n\nSource 8:\nAI experts such as Geoffrey Hinton <https://fortune.com/2023/05/01/godfather-ai-geoffrey-hinton-quit-google-regrets-lifes-work-bad-actors/> fear Silicon Valley executives won’t stop at just AGI: Mankind could ultimately create an artificial superintelligence (ASI).\n\nThis ASI would not just mimic human learning processes like current transformer-based neural networks such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, but could potentially gain self-awareness in the process—relegating humanity to the second-most advanced species on earth.\n\nWith so much riding on Altman’s ability to make the responsible decision, Emanuel fears past behavior suggests he can’t be trusted <https://fortune.com/2024/03/08/sam-altman-confirms-return-to-openai-board-as-law-firms-review-rips-loss-of-trust-that-led-to-his-sudden-ouster/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks> to properly develop groundbreaking technology—especially given a growing chorus of critics.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/chatgpt-openai-sam-altman-microsoft-ari-emanuel-endeavor-aspen/\n\nSource 9:\nAnd of course, the prospect of artificial general intelligence (AGI) appeals to us after decades of Hollywood movies where machines become so capable that they battle it out with humans.\n\nAlas, it seems unlikely that anything of the scale promised by the tech world—such as rapid advances towards singularity where machines can do everything <https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/could-advanced-ai-drive-explosive-economic-growth/> humans can—is even remotely possible. Even more grounded predictions such as those from Goldman Sachs <https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html> that generative AI will boost global GDP by 7% over the next decade and from the McKinsey Global Institute <https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-AI-the-next-productivity-frontier#/> that the annual GDP growth rate could increase by 3-4 percentage points between now and 2040, may be far too optimistic.\n\nWhat should we expect from AI?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/mit-economist-markets-overestimated-ai-driven-productivity-gains/\n\nSource 10:\nProponents say AI could lead to utopia <https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-utopia-or-dystopia-venture-capitalist-vinod-khosla-bd6c037c>, where poverty is eliminated, mankind finds the cure <https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/19/1079261/czi-ai-cell-disease/> to every disease, and all work is done by machines, leaving humans to spend their days idly enjoying their time. But skeptics say it could <https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/12/business/artificial-intelligence-ai-report-extinction/index.html> lead to the destruction <https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/10/technology/ai-humanity.html> of human civilization. Silver is not himself a doomer, but neither does he dismiss their concerns. \n\n“To dismiss these concerns is ignorant,” Silver said in On the Edge. “Ignorant of the scientific consensus, ignorant of the parameters of the debate, ignorant and profoundly incurious about mankind’s urge, with no clear exceptions so far in human history, to push technological development to the edge.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/nate-silver-sam-bankman-fried-sam-altman-openai-ftx-ai/'}

According to Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the field of AI, if AI surpasses human intelligence, it could potentially "get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over" [2]. This sentiment is echoed by Arthur C. Clarke, who predicted that machines would eventually "outthink their makers" and become the most intelligent inhabitants of the world [3]. If this were to happen, it could have severe consequences for humanity, including the potential loss of control over AI systems.

2024-11-08 06:37:45,062: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The possibility of artificial intelligence (AI) surpassing human intelligence is a topic of much debate and concern. According to Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the field of AI, if AI surpasses human intelligence, it could potentially "get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over" [2]. This sentiment is echoed by Arthur C. Clarke, who predicted that machines would eventually "outthink their makers" and become the most intelligent inhabitants of the world [3]. If this were to happen, it could have severe consequences for humanity, including the potential loss of control over AI systems.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, believes that the development of superintelligent AI could happen sooner than many people expect, potentially within a few thousand days [5].

According to Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the field of AI, if AI surpasses human intelligence, it could potentially "get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over" [2]. This sentiment is echoed by Arthur C. Clarke, who predicted that machines would eventually "outthink their makers" and become the most intelligent inhabitants of the world [3]. If this were to happen, it could have severe consequences for humanity, including the potential loss of control over AI systems.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, believes that the development of superintelligent AI could happen sooner than many people expect, potentially within a few thousand days [5].

According to Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the field of AI, if AI surpasses human intelligence, it could potentially "get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over" [2]. This sentiment is echoed by Arthur C. Clarke, who predicted that machines would eventually "outthink their makers" and become the most intelligent inhabitants of the world [3]. If this were to happen, it could have severe consequences for humanity, including the potential loss of control over AI systems.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, believes that the development of superintelligent AI could happen sooner than many people expect, potentially within a few thousand days [5].

According to Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the field of AI, if AI surpasses human intelligence, it could potentially "get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over" [2]. This sentiment is echoed by Arthur C. Clarke, who predicted that machines would eventually "outthink their makers" and become the most intelligent inhabitants of the world [3]. If this were to happen, it could have severe consequences for humanity, including the potential loss of control over AI systems.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, believes that the development of superintelligent AI could happen sooner than many people expect, potentially within a few thousand days [5].

2024-11-08 06:37:47,065: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The possibility of artificial intelligence (AI) surpassing human intelligence is a topic of much debate and concern. According to Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the field of AI, if AI surpasses human intelligence, it could potentially "get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over" [2]. This sentiment is echoed by Arthur C. Clarke, who predicted that machines would eventually "outthink their makers" and become the most intelligent inhabitants of the world [3]. If this were to happen, it could have severe consequences for humanity, including the potential loss of control over AI systems.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, believes that the development of superintelligent AI could happen sooner than many people expect, potentially within a few thousand days [5]. This raises concerns about the potential risks associated with advanced AI, including the possibility of an existential risk to humanity [4]. As Jeremy Kahn notes in his book "Mastering AI", the development of AI presents grave dangers, including the potential for AI to depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse [4]. If AI were to surpass human intelligence, it could exacerbate these risks and lead to significant negative consequences for society.

2024-11-08 06:37:47,243: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The possibility of artificial intelligence (AI) surpassing human intelligence is a topic of much debate and concern. According to Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the field of AI, if AI surpasses human intelligence, it could potentially "get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over" [2]. This sentiment is echoed by Arthur C. Clarke, who predicted that machines would eventually "outthink their makers" and become the most intelligent inhabitants of the world [3]. If this were to happen, it could have severe consequences for humanity, including the potential loss of control over AI systems.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, believes that the development of superintelligent AI could happen sooner than many people expect, potentially within a few thousand days [5]. This raises concerns about the potential risks associated with advanced AI, including the possibility of an existential risk to humanity [4]. As Jeremy Kahn notes in his book "Mastering AI", the development of AI presents grave dangers, including the potential for AI to depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse [4]. If AI were to surpass human intelligence, it could exacerbate these risks and lead to significant negative consequences for society.

The prospect of AI surpassing human intelligence also raises questions about the need for regulation and control. As a group of computer scientists recently argued, the development of AI should come with ethical norms for engineers, similar to those that apply to

2024-11-08 06:37:47,496: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The possibility of artificial intelligence (AI) surpassing human intelligence is a topic of much debate and concern. According to Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the field of AI, if AI surpasses human intelligence, it could potentially "get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over" [2]. This sentiment is echoed by Arthur C. Clarke, who predicted that machines would eventually "outthink their makers" and become the most intelligent inhabitants of the world [3]. If this were to happen, it could have severe consequences for humanity, including the potential loss of control over AI systems.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, believes that the development of superintelligent AI could happen sooner than many people expect, potentially within a few thousand days [5]. This raises concerns about the potential risks associated with advanced AI, including the possibility of an existential risk to humanity [4]. As Jeremy Kahn notes in his book "Mastering AI", the development of AI presents grave dangers, including the potential for AI to depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse [4]. If AI were to surpass human intelligence, it could exacerbate these risks and lead to significant negative consequences for society.

The prospect of AI surpassing human intelligence also raises questions about the need for regulation and control. As a group of computer scientists recently argued, the development of AI should come with ethical norms for engineers, similar to those that apply to doctors or lawyers [6]. Governments should also think of AI as a global public good, and work

This sentiment is echoed by Arthur C. Clarke, who predicted that machines would eventually "outthink their makers" and become the most intelligent inhabitants of the world [3]. If this were to happen, it could have severe consequences for humanity, including the potential loss of control over AI systems.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, believes that the development of superintelligent AI could happen sooner than many people expect, potentially within a few thousand days [5]. This raises concerns about the potential risks associated with advanced AI, including the possibility of an existential risk to humanity [4]. As Jeremy Kahn notes in his book "Mastering AI", the development of AI presents grave dangers, including the potential for AI to depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse [4]. If AI were to surpass human intelligence, it could exacerbate these risks and lead to significant negative consequences for society.

The prospect of AI surpassing human intelligence also raises questions about the need for regulation and control. As a group of computer scientists recently argued, the development of AI should come with ethical norms for engineers, similar to those that apply to doctors or lawyers [6]. Governments should also think of AI as a global public good, and work to prepare for

If AI were to surpass human intelligence, it could exacerbate these risks and lead to significant negative consequences for society.

The prospect of AI surpassing human intelligence also raises questions about the need for regulation and control. As a group of computer scientists recently argued, the development of AI should come with ethical norms for engineers, similar to those that apply to doctors or lawyers [6]. Governments should also think of AI as a global public good, and work to prepare for the potential risks associated with advanced AI [6].

2024-11-08 06:37:47,906: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The possibility of artificial intelligence (AI) surpassing human intelligence is a topic of much debate and concern. According to Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the field of AI, if AI surpasses human intelligence, it could potentially "get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over" [2]. This sentiment is echoed by Arthur C. Clarke, who predicted that machines would eventually "outthink their makers" and become the most intelligent inhabitants of the world [3]. If this were to happen, it could have severe consequences for humanity, including the potential loss of control over AI systems.

As a group of computer scientists recently argued, the development of AI should come with ethical norms for engineers, similar to those that apply to doctors or lawyers [6]. Governments should also think of AI as a global public good, and work to prepare for the potential risks associated with advanced AI [6]. Ultimately, the possibility of AI surpassing human intelligence highlights the need for careful consideration and planning to ensure that the development

2024-11-08 06:37:48,454: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The possibility of artificial intelligence (AI) surpassing human intelligence is a topic of much debate and concern. According to Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the field of AI, if AI surpasses human intelligence, it could potentially "get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over" [2]. This sentiment is echoed by Arthur C. Clarke, who predicted that machines would eventually "outthink their makers" and become the most intelligent inhabitants of the world [3]. If this were to happen, it could have severe consequences for humanity, including the potential loss of control over AI systems.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, believes that the development of superintelligent AI could happen sooner than many people expect, potentially within a few thousand days [5]. This raises concerns about the potential risks associated with advanced AI, including the possibility of an existential risk to humanity [4]. As Jeremy Kahn notes in his book "Mastering AI", the development of AI presents grave dangers, including the potential for AI to depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse [4].

As Jeremy Kahn notes in his book "Mastering AI", the development of AI presents grave dangers, including the potential for AI to depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse [4]. If AI were to surpass human intelligence, it could exacerbate these risks and lead to significant negative consequences for society.

The prospect of AI surpassing human intelligence also raises questions about the need for regulation and control. As a group of computer scientists recently argued, the development of AI should come with ethical norms for engineers, similar to those that apply to doctors or lawyers [6]. Governments should also think of AI as a global public good, and work to prepare for the potential risks associated with advanced AI [6]. Ultimately, the possibility of AI surpassing human intelligence highlights the need for careful consideration and planning to ensure that the development of AI benefits humanity, rather than posing a threat to our

According to Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the field of AI, if AI surpasses human intelligence, it could potentially "get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over" [2]. This sentiment is echoed by Arthur C. Clarke, who predicted that machines would eventually "outthink their makers" and become the most intelligent inhabitants of the world [3]. If this were to happen, it could have severe consequences for humanity, including the potential loss of control over AI systems.

According to Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the field of AI, if AI surpasses human intelligence, it could potentially "get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over" [2]. This sentiment is echoed by Arthur C. Clarke, who predicted that machines would eventually "outthink their makers" and become the most intelligent inhabitants of the world [3]. If this were to happen, it could have severe consequences for humanity, including the potential loss of control over AI systems.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, believes that the development of superintelligent AI could happen sooner than many people expect, potentially within a few thousand days [5]. This raises concerns about the potential risks associated with advanced AI, including the possibility of an existential risk to humanity [4]. As Jeremy Kahn notes in his book "Mastering AI", the development of AI presents grave dangers, including the potential for AI to depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse [4]. If AI were to surpass human intelligence, it could exacerbate these risks and lead to significant negative consequences for society.

The prospect of AI surpassing human intelligence also raises questions about the need for regulation and control. As a group of computer scientists recently argued, the development of AI should come with ethical norms for engineers, similar to those that apply to doctors or lawyers [6]. Governments should also think of AI as a global public good, and work to prepare for the potential risks associated with advanced AI [6]. Ultimately, the possibility of AI surpassing human intelligence highlights the need for careful consideration and planning to ensure that the development of AI benefits humanity, rather than posing a threat to our existence [4].
