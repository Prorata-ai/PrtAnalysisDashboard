In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials.

Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat, because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat. A newer theory is that the earth is actually expanding. This was first suggested about a quarter of a century ago, on purely cosmic grounds, by the great British theoretical physicist, P.A.M. Dirac. He reasoned that in an expanding universe, in which all bodies are seen to be rushing away from one another at a measurable rate, the force of gravity in any given body must be gradually diminishing with age. Even a slight decrease in the earth's gravity, unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means, could cause its matter to expand by as much as 1,100 miles in circumference in 3.25 billion years.

In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials.

Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat, because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat. A newer theory is that the earth is actually expanding. This was first suggested about a quarter of a century ago, on purely cosmic grounds, by the great British theoretical physicist, P.A.M. Dirac. He reasoned that in an expanding universe, in which all bodies are seen to be rushing away from one another at a measurable rate, the force of gravity in any given body must be gradually diminishing with age. Even a slight decrease in the earth's gravity, unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means, could cause its matter to expand by as much as 1,100 miles in circumference in 3.25 billion years.

The gravity "hills," being areas of great strain in the earth\'s mass, appear to coincide with the greatest earthquake zones. To sustain such gross irregularities in shape and mass without breaking apart, the earth must be exceedingly rigid and strong. The strains generated by these anomalies, according to space geodesists, must go down to the very core of the earth. They are so great that, to account for them, some have refurbished the theory, first suggested by George Darwin, that a great catastrophe once tore a huge mass out of what ·is now the Pacific Ocean to form the moon and perhaps Mars. A more plausible hypothesis, suggested by Gordon J. F.

In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials. The second discovery was that there are extensive irregularities in gravity over the earth, like great shallow hills and bowls.

Only gradually, over a period of about a billion years, did it heat up to the molten state through compression and radioactivity. The amount of contraction that could have occurred in cooling off since then is not sufficient to account for the earth's mountain heights and ocean depths. Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat, because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat. A newer theory is that the earth is actually expanding. This was first suggested about a quarter of a century ago, on purely cosmic grounds, by the great British theoretical physicist, P.A.M. Dirac. He reasoned that in an expanding universe, in which all bodies are seen to be rushing away from one another at a measurable rate, the force of gravity in any given body must be gradually diminishing with age. Even a slight decrease in the earth's gravity, unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means, could cause its matter to expand by as much as 1,100 miles in circumference in 3.25 billion years.

To sustain such gross irregularities in shape and mass without breaking apart, the earth must be exceedingly rigid and strong. The strains generated by these anomalies, according to space geodesists, must go down to the very core of the earth. They are so great that, to account for them, some have refurbished the theory, first suggested by George Darwin, that a great catastrophe once tore a huge mass out of what ·is now the Pacific Ocean to form the moon and perhaps Mars.

MacDonald of the University of California at Los Angeles, is that the deep strains are caused by a ten-million-year lag in the adjustment of the earth\'s shape to its declining rate of rotation.

In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials. The second discovery was that there are extensive irregularities in gravity over the earth, like great shallow hills and bowls.

Only gradually, over a period of about a billion years, did it heat up to the molten state through compression and radioactivity. The amount of contraction that could have occurred in cooling off since then is not sufficient to account for the earth's mountain heights and ocean depths. Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat, because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat. A newer theory is that the earth is actually expanding. This was first suggested about a quarter of a century ago, on purely cosmic grounds, by the great British theoretical physicist, P.A.M. Dirac. He reasoned that in an expanding universe, in which all bodies are seen to be rushing away from one another at a measurable rate, the force of gravity in any given body must be gradually diminishing with age. Even a slight decrease in the earth's gravity, unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means, could cause its matter to expand by as much as 1,100 miles in circumference in 3.25 billion years.

To sustain such gross irregularities in shape and mass without breaking apart, the earth must be exceedingly rigid and strong. The strains generated by these anomalies, according to space geodesists, must go down to the very core of the earth. They are so great that, to account for them, some have refurbished the theory, first suggested by George Darwin, that a great catastrophe once tore a huge mass out of what ·is now the Pacific Ocean to form the moon and perhaps Mars.

MacDonald of the University of California at Los Angeles, is that the deep strains are caused by a ten-million-year lag in the adjustment of the earth\'s shape to its declining rate of rotation.

Marcus, UP.Partners cofounder and managing partner, had agreed to take me up in the aerobatic plane. (Yes, aerobatics means precisely what you think it means.)\n\nWe did a bunch of rolls and loops in the air, which Marcus told me amounted to 4.3 Gs. I feel like I now understand phrases like “centrifugal force” and “weightlessness” not just intellectually but physically—you know that feeling, where a jugular physical rush pops the world into technicolor like in The Wizard of Oz? It’s like that. \n\n“It’s like a roller coaster, where you’re building the track yourself,” Marcus tells me once we’re back on the ground. This all connects together—Marcus’ UP.Partners invests in transportation tech, with a portfolio that includes Axiom Space, Skydio, Loft Dynamics, and Beyond Math. And aviation is part, though not all, of UP’s thesis.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/06/up-partners-ben-marcus-investing-in-transportation-tech-why-boeing-is-disruptable/\n\nSource 2:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\n“The centrifugal force will balance the force of the gravity,” says Dennis Wright, president of the Seattle-based International Space Elevator Consortium <https://www.isec.org/> (ISEC), which has studied and hosted conferences on the topic for two decades. “And it will stretch this cable tight and provide a vertical railroad, if you will, for vehicles that can grip the cable to climb up and down and deliver payloads.”\n\nThese climbers, traveling at speeds of a fast train, perhaps around 120 to 200 mph, could carry, for example, a 15-ton satellite every day or every other day. It could bring back from space, satellites and elements mined from asteroids. Such a vehicle might also carry tourists, of course, and it would be available every day, unburdened by rocket launch windows dependent on ideal conditions. “It changes everything. It’s just a completely different world,” says Edwards.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\nIn late August, officials at NASA announced what had already become apparent: Two U.S. astronauts, stranded for nearly three months at the International Space Station, weren\'t coming home as planned and would have to remain in space for several months.\n\nThe Boeing <https://fortune.com/company/boeing/> Starliner craft that transported Suni Williams and Barry Wilmore to the ISS <https://fortune.com/company/iss/> in June, the company’s first crewed mission, had experienced multiple problems and was returning to Earth without people on board. A SpaceX <https://fortune.com/company/spacex/> rescue craft, meanwhile, couldn’t reach the astronauts until February 2025.\n\nThe only option for Williams and Wilmore was to wait. But that may not always be the case. And if and when the scenario changes, it may well be in a direction that is quite literally the stuff of science fiction.\n\nThe technology is there\n\nFor more than a century in theory and at least a couple of decades in earnest, researchers have pondered the construction of a “space elevator” between Earth and distant space. Now, several scientists–and executives at one major Japanese company–believe the idea has wings.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\nWith the space elevator, no such fuel loads are needed. “You\'ll just use whatever electrical mechanism you have (on climbers) to get you up there,” plus a little fuel to correct positioning from time to time, Cohen said. “Right now, we have astronauts stuck 400 kilometers away and we\'re like help is on the way, just wait six months.”\n\nNASA, fairly famously risk-averse, heard out Edwards but hasn’t moved on the idea. (The agency was not able to immediately respond to questions, but recommended Edwards as a source.) Wright says several countries have at least studied the concept, including China and Japan—the Obayashi Corp. commitment is real enough.\n\nBut it may take international cooperation to actually get a space elevator built, in part because, without nations working together, there is always the chance of piracy or use of the idea for military advantage. There are also basic concerns like weather-related events, problems largely mitigated by locating the base, or the “Earth port,” near the equator in a specific region of the Pacific Ocean. “None of these seems to be showstoppers,” says Cohen. "So until someone finds one that has no solution, then I think onward.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\n“I think we have overcome the major problems (related to the space elevator),” says Yoji Ishikawa, an aerospace engineer in Japan who played a key role in developing Obayashi’s concept. The company’s planned 2025 construction start is on hold, Ishikawa says, as he looks for both international support and "many different industries to come together.”\nA space elevator could be used to get objects up to geosynchronous orbit (GEO), possibly as fast as a week’s time. At GEO, the orbital period matches Earth’s one-day rotation, allowing things to remain where they are positioned above us.

The stranded astronauts are currently stuck about 250 miles above us, where the International Space Station is located. Rockets need lots of fuel to go much farther, but the extra fuel then makes the rockets heavier, costing even more fuel and money.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\nToo, such mass-transport deliveries could prime the pump for asteroid mining, building a village on the moon, and establishing space-based solar power that could beam clean power to, say, New York or France. All might begin to be realized via a system that can get massive amounts of material to and from space quickly and at a low enough cost not to scare away investors, companies, or governments.\n\nTheoretically.\n\nIf this sounds like something a novelist might imagine, understand that it once was. The late sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke made the construction of a space elevator the centerpiece of his novel The Fountains of Paradise in 1979, almost half a century ago. In 2001, Clark wrote to Edwards to say he’d once predicted that it would be “50 years after everyone stops laughing” before the elevator would be built. After reading Edwards’ NASA report, Clark wrote, “They just stopped.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 3:\n“It had an incomplete, crude start of a schematic about how one might go about building a space elevator,” said Krane. “Then, it had a companion call-out on this big piece of butcher paper that said: ‘Finish this.’” Of course, that’s crazy – but it’s the kind of moonshot faith that empowers GV to this day. It’s what allows GV to, in a phrase that Krane taught me, “press the believe button.”\n\nIn the last scene of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Wonka asks Charlie to start the glass elevator.\n\n“There it goes,” Wilder says. “Hold on tight. I\'m not exactly sure what\'s going to happen. Faster, faster . . . If we don\'t pick up enough speed, we\'ll never get through.”\n\nThere’s a moment before the elevator makes impact with the ceiling, where it’s unclear what’s going to happen. Whether they will crash to their deaths, or whether Wonka, Charlie, and Grandpa Joe will rise to heights that were previously unimaginable. \n\nFor those who can find glee in this, the possibilities are endless.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/20/inside-google-ventures-15-years-startup-investing/\n\nSource 4:\nin its mantle as continental drift would imply. In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials. The second discovery was that there are extensive irregularities in gravity over the earth, like great shallow hills and bowls. Eight major gravity anomalies have been located, the two greatest being a deep depression or "bowl"\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/solving-the-riddle-of-the-shuddering-earth-fortune-classics-1965/\n\nSource 4:\ncold accretion of dust and gases whirling in a primordial disk around the sun. Only gradually, over a period of about a billion years, did it heat up to the molten state through compression and radioactivity. The amount of contraction that could have occurred in cooling off since then is not sufficient to account for the earth\'s mountain heights and ocean depths. Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat, because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat. A newer theory is that the earth is actually expanding. This was first suggested about a quarter of a century ago, on purely cosmic grounds, by the great British theoretical physicist, P.A.M. Dirac. He reasoned that in an expanding universe, in which all bodies are seen to be rushing away from one another at a measurable rate, the force of gravity in any given body must be gradually diminishing with age. Even a slight decrease in the earth\'s gravity, unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means, could cause its matter to expand by as much as 1,100 miles in circumference in 3.25 billion years. The expansion theory, long dormant, suddenly gained support from the discovery of the\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/solving-the-riddle-of-the-shuddering-earth-fortune-classics-1965/\n\nSource 4:\nEight major gravity anomalies have been located, the two greatest being a deep depression or "bowl" off the tip of India and a great "hill" or rise in the New Guinea area. The gravity "hills," being areas of great strain in the earth\'s mass, appear to coincide with the greatest earthquake zones. To sustain such gross irregularities in shape and mass without breaking apart, the earth must be exceedingly rigid and strong. The strains generated by these anomalies, according to space geodesists, must go down to the very core of the earth. They are so great that, to account for them, some have refurbished the theory, first suggested by George Darwin, that a great catastrophe once tore a huge mass out of what ·is now the Pacific Ocean to form the moon and perhaps Mars. A more plausible hypothesis, suggested by Gordon J. F. MacDonald of the University of California at Los Angeles, is that the deep strains are caused by a ten-million-year lag in the adjustment of the earth\'s shape to its declining rate of rotation. This lag stores vast tension or energy in the earth, like a coiled spring, accounting for all the shifts in its crust, including earthquakes. In this clash of theories, science progresses. And when the din is at\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/solving-the-riddle-of-the-shuddering-earth-fortune-classics-1965/\n\nSource 5:\nStill, Williams said, “This is my happy place…It’s very peaceful up here a lot of times.

It could bring back from space, satellites and elements mined from asteroids. Such a vehicle might also carry tourists, of course, and it would be available every day, unburdened by rocket launch windows dependent on ideal conditions. “It changes everything.

A SpaceX <https://fortune.com/company/spacex/> rescue craft, meanwhile, couldn’t reach the astronauts until February 2025.\n\nThe only option for Williams and Wilmore was to wait. But that may not always be the case. And if and when the scenario changes, it may well be in a direction that is quite literally the stuff of science fiction.\n\nThe technology is there\n\nFor more than a century in theory and at least a couple of decades in earnest, researchers have pondered the construction of a “space elevator” between Earth and distant space.

(The agency was not able to immediately respond to questions, but recommended Edwards as a source.) Wright says several countries have at least studied the concept, including China and Japan—the Obayashi Corp. commitment is real enough.\n\nBut it may take international cooperation to actually get a space elevator built, in part because, without nations working together, there is always the chance of piracy or use of the idea for military advantage. There are also basic concerns like weather-related events, problems largely mitigated by locating the base, or the “Earth port,” near the equator in a specific region of the Pacific Ocean. “None of these seems to be showstoppers,” says Cohen. "So until someone finds one that has no solution, then I think onward.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\n“I think we have overcome the major problems (related to the space elevator),” says Yoji Ishikawa, an aerospace engineer in Japan who played a key role in developing Obayashi’s concept.

All might begin to be realized via a system that can get massive amounts of material to and from space quickly and at a low enough cost not to scare away investors, companies, or governments.\n\nTheoretically.\n\nIf this sounds like something a novelist might imagine, understand that it once was. The late sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke made the construction of a space elevator the centerpiece of his novel The Fountains of Paradise in 1979, almost half a century ago. In 2001, Clark wrote to Edwards to say he’d once predicted that it would be “50 years after everyone stops laughing” before the elevator would be built. After reading Edwards’ NASA report, Clark wrote, “They just stopped.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 3:\n“It had an incomplete, crude start of a schematic about how one might go about building a space elevator,” said Krane. “Then, it had a companion call-out on this big piece of butcher paper that said: ‘Finish this.’” Of course, that’s crazy – but it’s the kind of moonshot faith that empowers GV to this day. It’s what allows GV to, in a phrase that Krane taught me, “press the believe button.”\n\nIn the last scene of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Wonka asks Charlie to start the glass elevator.\n\n“There it goes,” Wilder says. “Hold on tight. I\'m not exactly sure what\'s going to happen. Faster, faster . . . If we don\'t pick up enough speed, we\'ll never get through.”\n\nThere’s a moment before the elevator makes impact with the ceiling, where it’s unclear what’s going to happen.

In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials. The second discovery was that there are extensive irregularities in gravity over the earth, like great shallow hills and bowls. Eight major gravity anomalies have been located, the two greatest being a deep depression or "bowl"\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/solving-the-riddle-of-the-shuddering-earth-fortune-classics-1965/\n\nSource 4:\ncold accretion of dust and gases whirling in a primordial disk around the sun. Only gradually, over a period of about a billion years, did it heat up to the molten state through compression and radioactivity. The amount of contraction that could have occurred in cooling off since then is not sufficient to account for the earth\'s mountain heights and ocean depths. Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat, because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat. A newer theory is that the earth is actually expanding. This was first suggested about a quarter of a century ago, on purely cosmic grounds, by the great British theoretical physicist, P.A.M. Dirac. He reasoned that in an expanding universe, in which all bodies are seen to be rushing away from one another at a measurable rate, the force of gravity in any given body must be gradually diminishing with age. Even a slight decrease in the earth\'s gravity, unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means, could cause its matter to expand by as much as 1,100 miles in circumference in 3.25 billion years. The expansion theory, long dormant, suddenly gained support from the discovery of the\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/solving-the-riddle-of-the-shuddering-earth-fortune-classics-1965/\n\nSource 4:\nEight major gravity anomalies have been located, the two greatest being a deep depression or "bowl" off the tip of India and a great "hill" or rise in the New Guinea area. The gravity "hills," being areas of great strain in the earth\'s mass, appear to coincide with the greatest earthquake zones. To sustain such gross irregularities in shape and mass without breaking apart, the earth must be exceedingly rigid and strong. The strains generated by these anomalies, according to space geodesists, must go down to the very core of the earth. They are so great that, to account for them, some have refurbished the theory, first suggested by George Darwin, that a great catastrophe once tore a huge mass out of what ·is now the Pacific Ocean to form the moon and perhaps Mars. A more plausible hypothesis, suggested by Gordon J. F. MacDonald of the University of California at Los Angeles, is that the deep strains are caused by a ten-million-year lag in the adjustment of the earth\'s shape to its declining rate of rotation. This lag stores vast tension or energy in the earth, like a coiled spring, accounting for all the shifts in its crust, including earthquakes. In this clash of theories, science progresses.

Even a slight decrease in the earth\'s gravity, unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means, could cause its matter to expand by as much as 1,100 miles in circumference in 3.25 billion years. The expansion theory, long dormant, suddenly gained support from the discovery of the\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/solving-the-riddle-of-the-shuddering-earth-fortune-classics-1965/\n\nSource 4:\nEight major gravity anomalies have been located, the two greatest being a deep depression or "bowl" off the tip of India and a great "hill" or rise in the New Guinea area. The gravity "hills," being areas of great strain in the earth\'s mass, appear to coincide with the greatest earthquake zones. To sustain such gross irregularities in shape and mass without breaking apart, the earth must be exceedingly rigid and strong. The strains generated by these anomalies, according to space geodesists, must go down to the very core of the earth. They are so great that, to account for them, some have refurbished the theory, first suggested by George Darwin, that a great catastrophe once tore a huge mass out of what ·is now the Pacific Ocean to form the moon and perhaps Mars. A more plausible hypothesis, suggested by Gordon J. F. MacDonald of the University of California at Los Angeles, is that the deep strains are caused by a ten-million-year lag in the adjustment of the earth\'s shape to its declining rate of rotation. This lag stores vast tension or energy in the earth, like a coiled spring, accounting for all the shifts in its crust, including earthquakes. In this clash of theories, science progresses.

Marcus, UP.Partners cofounder and managing partner, had agreed to take me up in the aerobatic plane. (Yes, aerobatics means precisely what you think it means.)\n\nWe did a bunch of rolls and loops in the air, which Marcus told me amounted to 4.3 Gs. I feel like I now understand phrases like “centrifugal force” and “weightlessness” not just intellectually but physically—you know that feeling, where a jugular physical rush pops the world into technicolor like in The Wizard of Oz? It’s like that. \n\n“It’s like a roller coaster, where you’re building the track yourself,” Marcus tells me once we’re back on the ground. This all connects together—Marcus’ UP.Partners invests in transportation tech, with a portfolio that includes Axiom Space, Skydio, Loft Dynamics, and Beyond Math. And aviation is part, though not all, of UP’s thesis.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/06/up-partners-ben-marcus-investing-in-transportation-tech-why-boeing-is-disruptable/\n\nSource 2:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\n“The centrifugal force will balance the force of the gravity,” says Dennis Wright, president of the Seattle-based International Space Elevator Consortium <https://www.isec.org/> (ISEC), which has studied and hosted conferences on the topic for two decades. “And it will stretch this cable tight and provide a vertical railroad, if you will, for vehicles that can grip the cable to climb up and down and deliver payloads.”\n\nThese climbers, traveling at speeds of a fast train, perhaps around 120 to 200 mph, could carry, for example, a 15-ton satellite every day or every other day. It could bring back from space, satellites and elements mined from asteroids. Such a vehicle might also carry tourists, of course, and it would be available every day, unburdened by rocket launch windows dependent on ideal conditions. “It changes everything. It’s just a completely different world,” says Edwards.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\nIn late August, officials at NASA announced what had already become apparent: Two U.S. astronauts, stranded for nearly three months at the International Space Station, weren\'t coming home as planned and would have to remain in space for several months.\n\nThe Boeing <https://fortune.com/company/boeing/> Starliner craft that transported Suni Williams and Barry Wilmore to the ISS <https://fortune.com/company/iss/> in June, the company’s first crewed mission, had experienced multiple problems and was returning to Earth without people on board. A SpaceX <https://fortune.com/company/spacex/> rescue craft, meanwhile, couldn’t reach the astronauts until February 2025.\n\nThe only option for Williams and Wilmore was to wait. But that may not always be the case. And if and when the scenario changes, it may well be in a direction that is quite literally the stuff of science fiction.\n\nThe technology is there\n\nFor more than a century in theory and at least a couple of decades in earnest, researchers have pondered the construction of a “space elevator” between Earth and distant space. Now, several scientists–and executives at one major Japanese company–believe the idea has wings.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\nWith the space elevator, no such fuel loads are needed. “You\'ll just use whatever electrical mechanism you have (on climbers) to get you up there,” plus a little fuel to correct positioning from time to time, Cohen said. “Right now, we have astronauts stuck 400 kilometers away and we\'re like help is on the way, just wait six months.”\n\nNASA, fairly famously risk-averse, heard out Edwards but hasn’t moved on the idea. (The agency was not able to immediately respond to questions, but recommended Edwards as a source.) Wright says several countries have at least studied the concept, including China and Japan—the Obayashi Corp. commitment is real enough.\n\nBut it may take international cooperation to actually get a space elevator built, in part because, without nations working together, there is always the chance of piracy or use of the idea for military advantage. There are also basic concerns like weather-related events, problems largely mitigated by locating the base, or the “Earth port,” near the equator in a specific region of the Pacific Ocean. “None of these seems to be showstoppers,” says Cohen. "So until someone finds one that has no solution, then I think onward.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\n“I think we have overcome the major problems (related to the space elevator),” says Yoji Ishikawa, an aerospace engineer in Japan who played a key role in developing Obayashi’s concept. The company’s planned 2025 construction start is on hold, Ishikawa says, as he looks for both international support and "many different industries to come together.”\nA space elevator could be used to get objects up to geosynchronous orbit (GEO), possibly as fast as a week’s time. At GEO, the orbital period matches Earth’s one-day rotation, allowing things to remain where they are positioned above us. Right now, most missions and man-made objects <https://www.spoc.spaceforce.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/3462529/leo-meo-or-geo-diversifying-orbits-is-not-a-one-size-fits-all-mission-part-1-of#:~:text=LEO%20is%20the%20orbital%20range,satellites,%20to%20name%20a%20few.> in space remain in low earth orbit. The stranded astronauts are currently stuck about 250 miles above us, where the International Space Station is located. Rockets need lots of fuel to go much farther, but the extra fuel then makes the rockets heavier, costing even more fuel and money.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 2:\nToo, such mass-transport deliveries could prime the pump for asteroid mining, building a village on the moon, and establishing space-based solar power that could beam clean power to, say, New York or France. All might begin to be realized via a system that can get massive amounts of material to and from space quickly and at a low enough cost not to scare away investors, companies, or governments.\n\nTheoretically.\n\nIf this sounds like something a novelist might imagine, understand that it once was. The late sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke made the construction of a space elevator the centerpiece of his novel The Fountains of Paradise in 1979, almost half a century ago. In 2001, Clark wrote to Edwards to say he’d once predicted that it would be “50 years after everyone stops laughing” before the elevator would be built. After reading Edwards’ NASA report, Clark wrote, “They just stopped.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/astronauts-stuck-space-solution-elevator-science-tech/\n\nSource 3:\n“It had an incomplete, crude start of a schematic about how one might go about building a space elevator,” said Krane. “Then, it had a companion call-out on this big piece of butcher paper that said: ‘Finish this.’” Of course, that’s crazy – but it’s the kind of moonshot faith that empowers GV to this day. It’s what allows GV to, in a phrase that Krane taught me, “press the believe button.”\n\nIn the last scene of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Wonka asks Charlie to start the glass elevator.\n\n“There it goes,” Wilder says. “Hold on tight. I\'m not exactly sure what\'s going to happen. Faster, faster . . . If we don\'t pick up enough speed, we\'ll never get through.”\n\nThere’s a moment before the elevator makes impact with the ceiling, where it’s unclear what’s going to happen. Whether they will crash to their deaths, or whether Wonka, Charlie, and Grandpa Joe will rise to heights that were previously unimaginable. \n\nFor those who can find glee in this, the possibilities are endless.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/20/inside-google-ventures-15-years-startup-investing/\n\nSource 4:\nin its mantle as continental drift would imply. In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials. The second discovery was that there are extensive irregularities in gravity over the earth, like great shallow hills and bowls. Eight major gravity anomalies have been located, the two greatest being a deep depression or "bowl"\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/solving-the-riddle-of-the-shuddering-earth-fortune-classics-1965/\n\nSource 4:\ncold accretion of dust and gases whirling in a primordial disk around the sun. Only gradually, over a period of about a billion years, did it heat up to the molten state through compression and radioactivity. The amount of contraction that could have occurred in cooling off since then is not sufficient to account for the earth\'s mountain heights and ocean depths. Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat, because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat.

For one, objects would no longer be bound to the Earth's surface, and would instead float freely in space [4]. This is because gravity is what keeps us and everything else on the ground, and without it, the concept of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning. In fact, the very notion of a "surface" would become obsolete, as objects would no longer be subject to the forces that keep them grounded.

In the absence of gravity, the Earth itself would likely undergo significant changes. According to scientists, the planet's shape would shift and become irregular, with massive bulges and distortions

According to scientists, the planet's shape would shift and become irregular, with massive bulges and distortions [4]. This is because the force of gravity helps maintain the Earth's spherical shape, and without it, the planet's mass would redistribute in unpredictable ways. Furthermore,

For one, objects would no longer be bound to the Earth's surface, and would instead float freely in space [4]. This is because gravity is what keeps us and everything else on the ground, and without it, the concept of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning. In fact, the very notion of a "surface" would become obsolete, as objects would no longer be subject to the forces that keep them grounded.

In the absence of gravity, the Earth itself would likely undergo significant changes. According to scientists, the planet's shape would shift and become irregular, with massive bulges and distortions [4]. This is because the force of gravity helps maintain the Earth's spherical shape, and without it, the planet's mass would redistribute in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also disrupt the Earth's rotation and orbit, leading to

2024-11-08 06:52:59,416: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there was no gravity, the effects would be far-reaching and profound. For one, objects would no longer be bound to the Earth's surface, and would instead float freely in space [4]. This is because gravity is what keeps us and everything else on the ground, and without it, the concept of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning. In fact, the very notion of a "surface" would become obsolete, as objects would no longer be subject to the forces that keep them grounded.

In the absence of gravity, the Earth itself would likely undergo significant changes. According to scientists, the planet's shape would shift and become irregular, with massive bulges and distortions [4]. This is because the force of gravity helps maintain the Earth's spherical shape, and without it, the planet's mass would redistribute in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also disrupt the Earth's rotation and orbit, leading to chaotic and unpredictable effects on the planet's climate and geology [4].

In fact, the very notion of a "surface" would become obsolete, as objects would no longer be subject to the forces that keep them grounded.

In the absence of gravity, the Earth itself would likely undergo significant changes. According to scientists, the planet's shape would shift and become irregular, with massive bulges and distortions [4]. This is because the force of gravity helps maintain the Earth's spherical shape, and without it, the planet's mass would redistribute in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also disrupt the Earth's rotation and orbit, leading to chaotic and unpredictable effects on the planet's climate and geology [4].

2024-11-08 06:52:59,905: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there was no gravity, the effects would be far-reaching and profound. For one, objects would no longer be bound to the Earth's surface, and would instead float freely in space [4]. This is because gravity is what keeps us and everything else on the ground, and without it, the concept of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning. In fact, the very notion of a "surface" would become obsolete, as objects would no longer be subject to the forces that keep them grounded.

In the absence of gravity, the Earth itself would likely undergo significant changes. According to scientists, the planet's shape would shift and become irregular, with massive bulges and distortions [4]. This is because the force of gravity helps maintain the Earth's spherical shape, and without it, the planet's mass would redistribute in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also disrupt the Earth's rotation and orbit, leading to chaotic and unpredictable effects on the planet's climate and geology [4].

2024-11-08 06:53:00,170: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there was no gravity, the effects would be far-reaching and profound. For one, objects would no longer be bound to the Earth's surface, and would instead float freely in space [4]. This is because gravity is what keeps us and everything else on the ground, and without it, the concept of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning. In fact, the very notion of a "surface" would become obsolete, as objects would no longer be subject to the forces that keep them grounded.

In the absence of gravity, the Earth itself would likely undergo significant changes. According to scientists, the planet's shape would shift and become irregular, with massive bulges and distortions [4]. This is because the force of gravity helps maintain the Earth's spherical shape, and without it, the planet's mass would redistribute in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also disrupt the Earth's rotation and orbit, leading to chaotic and unpredictable effects on the planet's climate and geology [4].

The effects of zero gravity would also be felt at the human level. For astronauts like Suni Williams and Barry Wilmore, who are currently stranded in space, the absence of gravity is a daily reality [2]. However, for people on

2024-11-08 06:53:00,565: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there was no gravity, the effects would be far-reaching and profound. For one, objects would no longer be bound to the Earth's surface, and would instead float freely in space [4]. This is because gravity is what keeps us and everything else on the ground, and without it, the concept of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning. In fact, the very notion of a "surface" would become obsolete, as objects would no longer be subject to the forces that keep them grounded.

In the absence of gravity, the Earth itself would likely undergo significant changes. According to scientists, the planet's shape would shift and become irregular, with massive bulges and distortions [4]. This is because the force of gravity helps maintain the Earth's spherical shape, and without it, the planet's mass would redistribute in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also disrupt the Earth's rotation and orbit, leading to chaotic and unpredictable effects on the planet's climate and geology [4].

The effects of zero gravity would also be felt at the human level. For astronauts like Suni Williams and Barry Wilmore, who are currently stranded in space, the absence of gravity is a daily reality [2]. However, for people on Earth, the experience would be both exhilarating and disorienting. Imagine being able to float and move about with ease, unencumbered by the constraints of gravity [

2024-11-08 06:53:01,108: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there was no gravity, the effects would be far-reaching and profound. For one, objects would no longer be bound to the Earth's surface, and would instead float freely in space [4]. This is because gravity is what keeps us and everything else on the ground, and without it, the concept of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning. In fact, the very notion of a "surface" would become obsolete, as objects would no longer be subject to the forces that keep them grounded.

In the absence of gravity, the Earth itself would likely undergo significant changes. According to scientists, the planet's shape would shift and become irregular, with massive bulges and distortions [4]. This is because the force of gravity helps maintain the Earth's spherical shape, and without it, the planet's mass would redistribute in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also disrupt the Earth's rotation and orbit, leading to chaotic and unpredictable effects on the planet's climate and geology [4].

The effects of zero gravity would also be felt at the human level. For astronauts like Suni Williams and Barry Wilmore, who are currently stranded in space, the absence of gravity is a daily reality [2].

2024-11-08 06:53:01,130: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What would happen if there was no gravity?

2024-11-08 06:53:01,130: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there was no gravity, the effects would be far-reaching and profound. For one, objects would no longer be bound to the Earth's surface, and would instead float freely in space [4]. This is because gravity is what keeps us and everything else on the ground, and without it, the concept of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning. In fact, the very notion of a "surface" would become obsolete, as objects would no longer be subject to the forces that keep them grounded.

In the absence of gravity, the Earth itself would likely undergo significant changes. According to scientists, the planet's shape would shift and become irregular, with massive bulges and distortions [4]. This is because the force of gravity helps maintain the Earth's spherical shape, and without it, the planet's mass would redistribute in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also disrupt the Earth's rotation and orbit, leading to chaotic and unpredictable effects on the planet's climate and geology [4].

The effects of zero gravity would also be felt at the human level. For astronauts like Suni Williams and Barry Wilmore, who are currently stranded in space, the absence of gravity is a daily reality [2]. However, for people on Earth, the experience would be both exhilarating and disorienting. Imagine being able to float and move about with ease, unencumbered by the constraints of gravity [1]. It's a prospect that's both thrilling and unsettling, and one that challenges our fundamental understanding of the world and our place

2024-11-08 06:53:01,288: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there was no gravity, the effects would be far-reaching and profound. For one, objects would no longer be bound to the Earth's surface, and would instead float freely in space [4]. This is because gravity is what keeps us and everything else on the ground, and without it, the concept of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning. In fact, the very notion of a "surface" would become obsolete, as objects would no longer be subject to the forces that keep them grounded.

In the absence of gravity, the Earth itself would likely undergo significant changes. According to scientists, the planet's shape would shift and become irregular, with massive bulges and distortions [4]. This is because the force of gravity helps maintain the Earth's spherical shape, and without it, the planet's mass would redistribute in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also disrupt the Earth's rotation and orbit, leading to chaotic and unpredictable effects on the planet's climate and geology [4].

The effects of zero gravity would also be felt at the human level. For astronauts like Suni Williams and Barry Wilmore, who are currently stranded in space, the absence of gravity is a daily reality [2]. However, for people on Earth, the experience would be both exhilarating and disorienting. Imagine being able to float and move about with ease, unencumbered by the constraints of gravity [1]. It's a prospect that's both thrilling and unsettling, and one that challenges our fundamental understanding of the world and our place within it.

2024-11-08 06:53:01,472: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there was no gravity, the effects would be far-reaching and profound. For one, objects would no longer be bound to the Earth's surface, and would instead float freely in space [4]. This is because gravity is what keeps us and everything else on the ground, and without it, the concept of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning. In fact, the very notion of a "surface" would become obsolete, as objects would no longer be subject to the forces that keep them grounded.

In the absence of gravity, the Earth itself would likely undergo significant changes. According to scientists, the planet's shape would shift and become irregular, with massive bulges and distortions [4]. This is because the force of gravity helps maintain the Earth's spherical shape, and without it, the planet's mass would redistribute in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also disrupt the Earth's rotation and orbit, leading to chaotic and unpredictable effects on the planet's climate and geology [4].

The effects of zero gravity would also be felt at the human level. For astronauts like Suni Williams and Barry Wilmore, who are currently stranded in space, the absence of gravity is a daily reality [2].

In the absence of gravity, the Earth itself would likely undergo significant changes. According to scientists, the planet's shape would shift and become irregular, with massive bulges and distortions [4]. This is because the force of gravity helps maintain the Earth's spherical shape, and without it, the planet's mass would redistribute in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also disrupt the Earth's rotation and orbit, leading to chaotic and unpredictable effects on the planet's climate and geology [4].

The effects of zero gravity would also be felt at the human level. For astronauts like Suni Williams and Barry Wilmore, who are currently stranded in space, the absence of gravity is a daily reality [2]. However, for people on Earth, the experience would be both exhilarating and disorienting. Imagine being able to float and move about with ease, unencumbered by the constraints of gravity [1]. It's a prospect that's both thrilling and unsettling, and one that challenges our fundamental understanding of the world and our place within it. As scientists like Dennis Wright and Yoji Ishikawa explore the possibilities of space elevators and gravity-defying technologies, we may one day get to experience the thrill of weightlessness firsthand [2].

2024-11-08 06:53:01,698: ObserveEventsHandler(  206): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd last message: What would happen if there was no gravity?

2024-11-08 06:53:01,698: ObserveEventsHandler(  207): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd response: assistant: If there was no gravity, the effects would be far-reaching and profound. For one, objects would no longer be bound to the Earth's surface, and would instead float freely in space [4]. This is because gravity is what keeps us and everything else on the ground, and without it, the concept of "up" and "down" would lose all meaning. In fact, the very notion of a "surface" would become obsolete, as objects would no longer be subject to the forces that keep them grounded.

In the absence of gravity, the Earth itself would likely undergo significant changes. According to scientists, the planet's shape would shift and become irregular, with massive bulges and distortions [4]. This is because the force of gravity helps maintain the Earth's spherical shape, and without it, the planet's mass would redistribute in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the lack of gravity would also disrupt the Earth's rotation and orbit, leading to chaotic and unpredictable effects on the planet's climate and geology [4].

The effects of zero gravity would also be felt at the human level. For astronauts like Suni Williams and Barry Wilmore, who are currently stranded in space, the absence of gravity is a daily reality [2]. However, for people on Earth, the experience would be both exhilarating and disorienting. Imagine being able to float and move about with ease, unencumbered by the constraints of gravity [1]. It's a prospect that's both thrilling and unsettling, and one that challenges our fundamental understanding of the world and our place within it. As scientists like Dennis Wright and Yoji Ishikawa explore the possibilities of space elevators and gravity-defying technologies, we may one day get to experience the thrill of weightlessness firsthand [2].
