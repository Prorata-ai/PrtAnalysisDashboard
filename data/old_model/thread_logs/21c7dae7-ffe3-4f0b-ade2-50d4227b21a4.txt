Now the first six months of 2024 have broken even those.\n\nWithout human-caused climate change <https://apnews.com/hub/environment>, scientists say that extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years.\n\nFormer head of U.N. climate negotiations Christiana Figueres said “we all scorch and fry” if the world doesn\'t immediately change course.\n\n“One third of global electricity can be produced by solar and wind alone, but targeted national policies have to enable that transformation,” she said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/24/monday-july-22-hottest-day-recorded-on-earth/\n\nSource 1:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/07/24/monday-july-22-hottest-day-recorded-on-earth/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/24/monday-july-22-hottest-day-recorded-on-earth/\n\nSource 1:\nMonday was recorded as the hottest day ever globally, beating a record set the day before <https://apnews.com/article/hottest-day-climate-change-heat-wave-warming-71e3e9d1fbfdc8503ef36eabec9390bd>, as countries around the world from Japan to Bolivia to the United States continue to feel the heat, according to the European climate change service.\n\nProvisional satellite data <https://pulse.climate.copernicus.eu/> published by Copernicus on Wednesday showed that Monday broke the previous day\'s record by 0.06 degrees Celsius (0.1 degree Fahrenheit).\n\nClimate scientists say the world is now as warm as it was 125,000 years ago because of human-caused climate change. While scientists cannot be certain that Monday was the very hottest day throughout that period, average temperatures have not been this high since long before humans developed agriculture.\n\nThe temperature rise in recent decades is in line with what climate scientists projected would happen if humans kept burning fossil fuels at an increasing rate.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/24/monday-july-22-hottest-day-recorded-on-earth/\n\nSource 2:\nThe spacecraft, the largest NASA <https://fortune.com/2017/11/07/jupiter-nasa-photos-juno/> has ever built for a planetary mission, will travel 1.8 million miles to reach Jupiter in April of 2030. It will conduct 49 close flybys of Europa and orbit Jupiter. Flybys will take place every two or three weeks and will bring Clipper within 16 miles of the surface.\n\nWhile the stated mission of the orbiter is to “determine if Europa has conditions suitable to support life,” scientists aren’t looking for existing life on the moon. They’re more interested to learn more about the composition of the ocean and what is behind plumes that have been seen shooting up through the ice. \n\nAnd, of course, they want to know whether it’s habitable, as NASA says “abundant liquid water, energy, and the right chemical elements make Europa one of the best places in the solar system to seek present-day life beyond Earth.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/14/nasa-launch-europa-clipper-mission-jupiter-moon-suitable-life/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/14/nasa-launch-europa-clipper-mission-jupiter-moon-suitable-life/\n\nSource 3:\nThe northern meteorological summer — June, July and August — averaged 16.8 degrees Celsius (62.24 degrees Fahrenheit), according to Copernicus.

Copernicus records go back to 1940, but American, British and Japanese records, which start in the mid-19th century, show the last decade has been the hottest since regular measurements were taken and likely in about 120,000 years <https://apnews.com/article/hottest-day-ever-climate-change-weather-heat-extreme-global-warming-8e2b0b7fa0360ecb931ca333a832c694>, according to some scientists.\n\nThe Augusts of both 2024 and 2023 tied for the hottest Augusts globally at 16.82 degrees Celsius (62.27 degrees Fahrenheit). July was the first time in more than a year that the world did not set a record, a tad behind 2023, but because June 2024 was so much hotter than June 2023, this summer as a whole was the hottest, Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/06/summer-2024-officially-sweltered-earth-hottest-record/\n\nSource 4:\nIndeed, China overtook <https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202308/13/WS64d8e615a31035260b81bd80.html__;!!AQdq3sQhfUj4q8uUguY!h6fp5mY4FSAK4rGcR0XSVjL8VLHmdlD1SU4uzHEg9DCpD0xTvFBnY3rK8Xohyjpiiqs2m4vGCbaw4oFhRxe1oKdI$> Greece as the largest ship-owning nation in 2023, and The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is now reportedly the largest\nin 2023, and The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is now reportedly the largest <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF__;!!AQdq3sQhfUj4q8uUguY!h6fp5mY4FSAK4rGcR0XSVjL8VLHmdlD1SU4uzHEg9DCpD0xTvFBnY3rK8Xohyjpiiqs2m4vGCbaw4oFhRwKP3ctZ$> in the world.

It’s also come under scrutiny for its above-ground power lines prone to toppling due to extreme weather.\n\n“Our (power) infrastructure was built for the weather of the past,” Michael Webber, professor of engineering at the University of Texas, told CNN <https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/weather/power-grid-outages-us-texas-climate/index.html>. “It wasn’t built for the weather of the future, and the weather of the future is already here.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/10/texas-whataburger-hurricane-beryl-private-energy-provider-power-outage/\n\nSource 6:\nSuperyachts are the ultimate status symbol for royal families, oligarchs and billionaires from Jeff Bezos to Bernard Arnault. The floating palaces are a source of fascination and secrecy — and greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nThe planet-warming pollution caused by luxury vessels that benefit the very few has led lifestyle social scientist Gregory Salle to dub them a form of “ecocide” and “conspicuous seclusion” in his new book, Superyachts: Luxury, Tranquility and Ecocide.\n\nThere are almost 6,000 superyachts — that is, vessels over 30 meters (100 feet) — at sea, according to a report earlier this year by media and market intelligence company SuperYacht Times. The total has quadrupled in the past three decades. \n\n“It’s hard to think about a sign of wealth that is more convincing than that if you possess a superyacht,” said Salle, who is a professor at France’s University of Lille. \n\nThe concentration of wealth hasn’t just led to the superyacht explosion. It’s also led to a split in per-capita emissions, with the most well-off living the highest carbon lifestyles.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/09/climate-economics-worlds-6000-superyachts-its-not-an-entirely-rational-decision/\n\nSource 7:\nDuring July <https://apnews.com/article/heat-wave-record-temperatures-2ca3046bf74ca596b24a2879d8dcf664>, the world was 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer, by Copernicus’ measurement, than pre-industrial times. That\'s close to the warming limit that nearly all the countries in the world agreed to in the 2015 Paris climate agreement: 1.5 degrees <https://apnews.com/article/climate-science-business-scotland-europe-7b282af7df95b55dff2630e158631a73>.\n\nEl Nino — which naturally warms the Pacific Ocean and changes weather across the globe — spurred the 13 months of record heat, said Copernicus senior climate scientist Julien Nicolas. That has come to a close, hence July’s slight easing of temperatures. La Nina conditions — natural cooling — aren\'t expected until later in the year.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/08/july-first-month-year-not-set-heat-record-el-nino-climate-change/\n\nSource 8:\nThat’s according to the latest report <https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60419#_idTextAnchor001> from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

The National Indian Gaming Commission, making its first appearance on the survey, was first among small agencies.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/20/federal-government-jobs-best-worst-agencies-employee-satisfaction-engagement-survey/'}

The previous record before this week was set just a year ago. Before last year, the previous recorded hottest day was in 2016 when average temperatures were at 16.8 degrees Celsius, or 62.24 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWhile 2024 has been extremely warm, what kicked this week into new territory was a warmer-than-usual Antarctic winter, according to Copernicus. The same thing happened on the southern continent last year when the record was set in early July.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/24/monday-july-22-hottest-day-recorded-on-earth/\n\nSource 1:\nCopernicus records go back to 1940, but other global measurements by the United States and United Kingdom governments go back even further, to 1880. Many scientists, taking those into consideration along with tree rings and ice cores, say last year’s record highs were the hottest the planet has been in about 120,000 years <https://apnews.com/article/global-heat-record-hottest-climate-change-july-7d55e351fc97f5cd6368bda60ed2bf31>. Now the first six months of 2024 have broken even those.\n\nWithout human-caused climate change <https://apnews.com/hub/environment>, scientists say that extreme temperature records would not be broken nearly as frequently as is happening in recent years.\n\nFormer head of U.N. climate negotiations Christiana Figueres said “we all scorch and fry” if the world doesn\'t immediately change course.\n\n“One third of global electricity can be produced by solar and wind alone, but targeted national policies have to enable that transformation,” she said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/24/monday-july-22-hottest-day-recorded-on-earth/\n\nSource 1:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/07/24/monday-july-22-hottest-day-recorded-on-earth/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/24/monday-july-22-hottest-day-recorded-on-earth/\n\nSource 1:\nMonday was recorded as the hottest day ever globally, beating a record set the day before <https://apnews.com/article/hottest-day-climate-change-heat-wave-warming-71e3e9d1fbfdc8503ef36eabec9390bd>, as countries around the world from Japan to Bolivia to the United States continue to feel the heat, according to the European climate change service.\n\nProvisional satellite data <https://pulse.climate.copernicus.eu/> published by Copernicus on Wednesday showed that Monday broke the previous day\'s record by 0.06 degrees Celsius (0.1 degree Fahrenheit).\n\nClimate scientists say the world is now as warm as it was 125,000 years ago because of human-caused climate change. While scientists cannot be certain that Monday was the very hottest day throughout that period, average temperatures have not been this high since long before humans developed agriculture.\n\nThe temperature rise in recent decades is in line with what climate scientists projected would happen if humans kept burning fossil fuels at an increasing rate.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/24/monday-july-22-hottest-day-recorded-on-earth/\n\nSource 2:\nThe spacecraft, the largest NASA <https://fortune.com/2017/11/07/jupiter-nasa-photos-juno/> has ever built for a planetary mission, will travel 1.8 million miles to reach Jupiter in April of 2030. It will conduct 49 close flybys of Europa and orbit Jupiter. Flybys will take place every two or three weeks and will bring Clipper within 16 miles of the surface.\n\nWhile the stated mission of the orbiter is to “determine if Europa has conditions suitable to support life,” scientists aren’t looking for existing life on the moon. They’re more interested to learn more about the composition of the ocean and what is behind plumes that have been seen shooting up through the ice. \n\nAnd, of course, they want to know whether it’s habitable, as NASA says “abundant liquid water, energy, and the right chemical elements make Europa one of the best places in the solar system to seek present-day life beyond Earth.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/14/nasa-launch-europa-clipper-mission-jupiter-moon-suitable-life/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/14/nasa-launch-europa-clipper-mission-jupiter-moon-suitable-life/\n\nSource 3:\nThe northern meteorological summer — June, July and August — averaged 16.8 degrees Celsius (62.24 degrees Fahrenheit), according to Copernicus. That\'s 0.03 degrees Celsius (0.05 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the old record in 2023. Copernicus records go back to 1940, but American, British and Japanese records, which start in the mid-19th century, show the last decade has been the hottest since regular measurements were taken and likely in about 120,000 years <https://apnews.com/article/hottest-day-ever-climate-change-weather-heat-extreme-global-warming-8e2b0b7fa0360ecb931ca333a832c694>, according to some scientists.\n\nThe Augusts of both 2024 and 2023 tied for the hottest Augusts globally at 16.82 degrees Celsius (62.27 degrees Fahrenheit). July was the first time in more than a year that the world did not set a record, a tad behind 2023, but because June 2024 was so much hotter than June 2023, this summer as a whole was the hottest, Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/06/summer-2024-officially-sweltered-earth-hottest-record/\n\nSource 4:\nIndeed, China overtook <https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202308/13/WS64d8e615a31035260b81bd80.html__;!!AQdq3sQhfUj4q8uUguY!h6fp5mY4FSAK4rGcR0XSVjL8VLHmdlD1SU4uzHEg9DCpD0xTvFBnY3rK8Xohyjpiiqs2m4vGCbaw4oFhRxe1oKdI$> Greece as the largest ship-owning nation in 2023, and The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is now reportedly the largest\nin 2023, and The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is now reportedly the largest <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF__;!!AQdq3sQhfUj4q8uUguY!h6fp5mY4FSAK4rGcR0XSVjL8VLHmdlD1SU4uzHEg9DCpD0xTvFBnY3rK8Xohyjpiiqs2m4vGCbaw4oFhRwKP3ctZ$> in the world.

It’s also come under scrutiny for its above-ground power lines prone to toppling due to extreme weather.\n\n“Our (power) infrastructure was built for the weather of the past,” Michael Webber, professor of engineering at the University of Texas, told CNN <https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/weather/power-grid-outages-us-texas-climate/index.html>. “It wasn’t built for the weather of the future, and the weather of the future is already here.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/10/texas-whataburger-hurricane-beryl-private-energy-provider-power-outage/\n\nSource 6:\nSuperyachts are the ultimate status symbol for royal families, oligarchs and billionaires from Jeff Bezos to Bernard Arnault. The floating palaces are a source of fascination and secrecy — and greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nThe planet-warming pollution caused by luxury vessels that benefit the very few has led lifestyle social scientist Gregory Salle to dub them a form of “ecocide” and “conspicuous seclusion” in his new book, Superyachts: Luxury, Tranquility and Ecocide.\n\nThere are almost 6,000 superyachts — that is, vessels over 30 meters (100 feet) — at sea, according to a report earlier this year by media and market intelligence company SuperYacht Times. The total has quadrupled in the past three decades. \n\n“It’s hard to think about a sign of wealth that is more convincing than that if you possess a superyacht,” said Salle, who is a professor at France’s University of Lille. \n\nThe concentration of wealth hasn’t just led to the superyacht explosion. It’s also led to a split in per-capita emissions, with the most well-off living the highest carbon lifestyles.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/09/climate-economics-worlds-6000-superyachts-its-not-an-entirely-rational-decision/\n\nSource 7:\nDuring July <https://apnews.com/article/heat-wave-record-temperatures-2ca3046bf74ca596b24a2879d8dcf664>, the world was 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer, by Copernicus’ measurement, than pre-industrial times. That\'s close to the warming limit that nearly all the countries in the world agreed to in the 2015 Paris climate agreement: 1.5 degrees <https://apnews.com/article/climate-science-business-scotland-europe-7b282af7df95b55dff2630e158631a73>.\n\nEl Nino — which naturally warms the Pacific Ocean and changes weather across the globe — spurred the 13 months of record heat, said Copernicus senior climate scientist Julien Nicolas. That has come to a close, hence July’s slight easing of temperatures. La Nina conditions — natural cooling — aren\'t expected until later in the year.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/08/july-first-month-year-not-set-heat-record-el-nino-climate-change/\n\nSource 8:\nThat’s according to the latest report <https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60419#_idTextAnchor001> from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

The National Indian Gaming Commission, making its first appearance on the survey, was first among small agencies.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/20/federal-government-jobs-best-worst-agencies-employee-satisfaction-engagement-survey/'}

2024-11-08 06:48:24,459: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Unfortunately, I don't have information about the largest planet in our solar system from the provided sources. However, I can tell you that one of the sources mentions a NASA mission to Jupiter, which is often considered the largest planet in our solar system [2]. But I don't have any direct information to confirm this.

If you're interested, I can tell you more about the NASA mission to Jupiter's moon Europa, which is scheduled to launch and will conduct 49 close flybys of the moon [2]. The mission aims to determine if Europa has conditions suitable to support life.
