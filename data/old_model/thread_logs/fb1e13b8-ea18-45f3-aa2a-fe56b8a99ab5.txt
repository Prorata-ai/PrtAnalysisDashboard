But while senior members of both of Britain’s two dominant political parties were there, the influence campaign had increasingly targeted Labour, given its large and consistent lead in polls. \n\nSunak’s decision to call a July 4 election validated that approach, but it also underscored the sense of uncertainty hanging over crypto in the UK. Labour hasn’t been in power since 2010, when Bitcoin was worth less than a dollar. And its leader, Keir Starmer, has been mostly silent on cryptocurrencies. \n\n“Everyone is trying to guess,” what Starmer intends to do in crypto regulation should Labour win, said Laura Navaratnam, UK policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation. “Part of the answer here is quite possibly that Labour don’t know what they think yet.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/12/snap-u-k-election-sends-crypto-industry-scrambling-to-court-labour-allies/\n\nSource 1:\nThe UK is Coinbase’s second-largest market, yet many in the industry view the country as a laggard in crypto regulation.

Since then, the European Union (from which the UK voted in 2016 to part ways) has adopted sweeping crypto legislation, and rival financial centers like Hong Kong and Dubai have introduced new regulations. \n\nBy contrast, the UK mostly relies on a patchwork of crypto rules mainly enforced by the Financial Conduct Authority.

The U.K.’s exit from the European Union followed by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine battered the economy. Rising poverty and cuts to state services have led to gripes about “Broken Britain.”\n\nGermany’s DAX rose 0.2% after the government agreed on a budget for 2025 <https://apnews.com/article/germany-budget-agreement-stimulus-coalition-a95dbc1d92c70ee2c10e921b8a5e0762> and a stimulus package for Europe’s largest economy, ending a monthslong squabble that threatened to upend Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s center-left coalition.\n\nThe disagreements had fueled speculation that the already unpopular government could collapse and prompt a snap parliamentary election in which Germany could follow other European countries by swinging toward the political right <https://apnews.com/article/france-election-campaign-left-right-violence-386f52a46a2eca14d3c15897e15a853a>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/05/stocks-near-records-wall-street-strong-jobs-report/\n\nSource 3:\nTo be sure, the U.K. has had some wins in labor-force-related metrics, such as a low unemployment rate and strong wage growth.

This means putting it first in decisions on public spending, tax policy, regulation, and international economic policy,” Creon Butler, director of the global economy and finance program at Chatham House, said in a May report <https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/05/next-uk-government-must-make-productivity-its-top-priority>.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/12/uk-missing-workers-economic-inactive-quiet-quitting-economy-nearly-400-billion-productivity-crisis/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/12/uk-missing-workers-economic-inactive-quiet-quitting-economy-nearly-400-billion-productivity-crisis/\n\nSource 4:\nAccording to Jens Eisenschmidt, Morgan Stanley’s chief economist for Europe, it has at least led analysts to find an easy way to sum up the embattled nation.\n\n“Think about Europe, but everything a little worse,” is how Eisenschmidt describes the U.K.’s current economic status.\n\nIt’s a sentiment that bore out in the OECD’s latest outlook, and one that has policymakers in the country on the ropes.\n\nThe U.K.’s central bank, the Bank of England, is expected to be slower out of the block than the European Central Bank (ECB) in introducing interest rate cuts to stimulate growth, Eisenschmidt says. \n\nThe U.K. is suffering from stickier inflation than its European peers. Prices rose by 2.4% in the Eurozone in April, while in March the U.K.’s CPI rate measured 3.4%, putting the former on a faster track to interest rate cuts.\n\nEisenschmidt said the source of this stickier inflation was up for debate. However, the blame could be pinned on a mounting worklessness crisis in the U.K.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/04/think-about-europe-but-everything-a-little-worse-the-u-k-economy-could-stare-down-long-term-irrelevance-without-immigration/\n\nSource 4:\nEconomic inactivity has been soaring in the country, accelerated by a growing long-term sickness trend and youth unemployment <https://fortune.com/europe/2024/03/14/youth-mental-health-crisis-uk-3-million-gen-zers-labor-force/>.\n\nThe country hasn’t been able to benefit from migration flows to offset a tight labor market, unlike in the European Union’s common market. \n\nAs a small open economy, the U.K. has also been more vulnerable than the EU to a flight of capital following market shocks, as summed up by the currency hammering budget of September 2022. \n\nEisenschmidt said these pressures left the U.K. “more exposed to the need for household discipline” in the short run. \n\nThe outcome of this year’s U.K. General Election, the date of which is pending, is another major short-term variable impacting the fortunes of the economy.\n\nAging populations\n\nA trend of labor market flows having an outsized impact on economic performance is one the U.K. should get used to.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/04/think-about-europe-but-everything-a-little-worse-the-u-k-economy-could-stare-down-long-term-irrelevance-without-immigration/\n\nSource 5:\nJulia Hoggett, chief executive officer of London Stock Exchange Plc, speaks during The Power of Action: LGBTQIA+ Inclusion event panel discussion at Bloomberg LP's European headquarters in London, UK, on Thursday, June 22, 2023.

It will take years of deliberate efforts to invest in skills and training while also improving job opportunities and access to health care for the next generation of workers. \n\nThe Bank of England’s course with interest rates will also help determine what’s in store for the economy. \n\nThe Labour Party has promised to focus on “sustainable growth.” With the budget due to be announced on Oct. 30, it will have to iron out specific steps that address productivity and worklessness to jump-start economic growth.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/10/britain-workforce-productivity-youth-worklessness/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/10/britain-workforce-productivity-youth-worklessness/\n\nSource 9:\nKeir Starmer called for a “mature conversation” with social media companies to limit malicious content that’s stoked days of rioting in the UK. Instead, he found himself in an escalating online confrontation with Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X.\n\nNow, the UK is mulling steps to tighten the regulation of platforms like Musk’s — and finding it has few levers, especially when the owner is a major amplifier of misinformation. One step would be to revive a key provision in the Online Safety Act, set to be implemented later this year, giving authorities more power to force social media companies to curb harmful content, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\n“Very swiftly the government has realised there needs to be amendments to the Online Safety Act,” London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the Guardian newspaper. “I think what the government should do very quickly is check if it is fit for purpose. I think it’s not fit for purpose.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/09/elon-musk-riot-comments-uk-tougher-social-media-rules-x-meta-twitter-google-alphabet-tiktok/\n\nSource 9:\nUK officials are discussing whether to revisit part of the Online Safety Act, according to the people familiar with the efforts. The bill was watered down by the last government, which removed language that would have regulated “legal but harmful” content in order to allay concerns of free speech campaigners. The legislation gives regulators the power to impose large fines and, in extreme cases, block social media platforms that don’t comply.\n\nOn Monday, Kyle’s office said he met with executives from Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, TikTok and X to discuss “the spread of hateful misinformation and incitement.”\n\nAfter over 30 minutes, Musk appears to have finally deleted the post \n\nNo acknowledgement yet\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/09/elon-musk-riot-comments-uk-tougher-social-media-rules-x-meta-twitter-google-alphabet-tiktok/"}

However, the blame could be pinned on a mounting worklessness crisis in the U.K.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/04/think-about-europe-but-everything-a-little-worse-the-u-k-economy-could-stare-down-long-term-irrelevance-without-immigration/\n\nSource 4:\nEconomic inactivity has been soaring in the country, accelerated by a growing long-term sickness trend and youth unemployment <https://fortune.com/europe/2024/03/14/youth-mental-health-crisis-uk-3-million-gen-zers-labor-force/>.\n\nThe country hasn’t been able to benefit from migration flows to offset a tight labor market, unlike in the European Union’s common market. \n\nAs a small open economy, the U.K. has also been more vulnerable than the EU to a flight of capital following market shocks, as summed up by the currency hammering budget of September 2022. \n\nEisenschmidt said these pressures left the U.K. “more exposed to the need for household discipline” in the short run. \n\nThe outcome of this year’s U.K. General Election, the date of which is pending, is another major short-term variable impacting the fortunes of the economy.\n\nAging populations\n\nA trend of labor market flows having an outsized impact on economic performance is one the U.K. should get used to.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/04/think-about-europe-but-everything-a-little-worse-the-u-k-economy-could-stare-down-long-term-irrelevance-without-immigration/\n\nSource 5:\nJulia Hoggett, chief executive officer of London Stock Exchange Plc, speaks during The Power of Action: LGBTQIA+ Inclusion event panel discussion at Bloomberg LP's European headquarters in London, UK, on Thursday, June 22, 2023.

The number of international investors saw a similar decline, falling from 437 in H1 2023 to 326 in 2024.\n\nWith the arrival of new U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, many will be hoping that the first Labour government in 14 years will continue to support the U.K.’s position as a critical player in the global tech landscape.\n\nCorrection, July 8, 2024: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Mews was founded in Amsterdam.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/07/05/uk-tech-overtakes-china-cementing-position-worlds-second-largest-ecosystem-funding/\n\nSource 7:\nBrokers chalk much of the market uncertainty to July’s election, which was well-flagged to be a shift in government during the proceeding year. The Labour party, which won a resounding victory, had been consistently polling higher than the Conservatives, who had been in power for over a decade. High interest rates also weighed on sentiment; the Bank of England delivered its first cut in four years <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-01/the-bank-of-england-finally-delivers-that-rate-cut> just this August.\n\nUncertainty has now shifted onto the ramifications of the new government, specifically uncertainty surrounding a new tax regime, says Stuart Bailey, head of super prime sales London at Knight Frank. Tax hikes have been floated by the new Labour government <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/uk-s-richest-face-prospect-of-sharp-labour-tax-hikes-on-wealth>, including possible increases to capital gains and inheritance taxes, which will be revealed in the upcoming UK budget, set for Oct. 30.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/09/21/london-housing-real-estate/\n\nSource 8:\nExperts suggest that addressing productivity doesn’t have a one-shot <https://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/uk-productivity-paralysis> solution. It will take years of deliberate efforts to invest in skills and training while also improving job opportunities and access to health care for the next generation of workers. \n\nThe Bank of England’s course with interest rates will also help determine what’s in store for the economy. \n\nThe Labour Party has promised to focus on “sustainable growth.” With the budget due to be announced on Oct. 30, it will have to iron out specific steps that address productivity and worklessness to jump-start economic growth.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/10/britain-workforce-productivity-youth-worklessness/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/10/britain-workforce-productivity-youth-worklessness/\n\nSource 9:\nKeir Starmer called for a “mature conversation” with social media companies to limit malicious content that’s stoked days of rioting in the UK. Instead, he found himself in an escalating online confrontation with Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X.\n\nNow, the UK is mulling steps to tighten the regulation of platforms like Musk’s — and finding it has few levers, especially when the owner is a major amplifier of misinformation. One step would be to revive a key provision in the Online Safety Act, set to be implemented later this year, giving authorities more power to force social media companies to curb harmful content, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\n“Very swiftly the government has realised there needs to be amendments to the Online Safety Act,” London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the Guardian newspaper. “I think what the government should do very quickly is check if it is fit for purpose. I think it’s not fit for purpose.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/09/elon-musk-riot-comments-uk-tougher-social-media-rules-x-meta-twitter-google-alphabet-tiktok/\n\nSource 9:\nUK officials are discussing whether to revisit part of the Online Safety Act, according to the people familiar with the efforts. The bill was watered down by the last government, which removed language that would have regulated “legal but harmful” content in order to allay concerns of free speech campaigners. The legislation gives regulators the power to impose large fines and, in extreme cases, block social media platforms that don’t comply.\n\nOn Monday, Kyle’s office said he met with executives from Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, TikTok and X to discuss “the spread of hateful misinformation and incitement.”\n\nAfter over 30 minutes, Musk appears to have finally deleted the post \n\nNo acknowledgement yet\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/09/elon-musk-riot-comments-uk-tougher-social-media-rules-x-meta-twitter-google-alphabet-tiktok/"}
