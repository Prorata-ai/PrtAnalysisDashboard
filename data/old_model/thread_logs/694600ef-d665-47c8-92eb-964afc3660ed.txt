The July employment report came in far weaker than anticipated last week, with the U.S. economy adding 114,000 jobs, compared to economists’ consensus forecast for 175,000. The unemployment also rose to 4.3%, triggering one of the most accurate recession indicators, the infamous Sahm Rule.\n\n“The immediate implication is that investors fear that the economy may weaken rapidly and want the Fed to cut rates aggressively to maintain economic growth,” Wells Fargo’s Christopher explained. \n\nHowever, the global stock market rout began in Japan on Monday, where the Nikkei 225 plunged 12% in its worst day since 1987. And some say the so-called “carry trade” may be to blame for Japan’s dark Monday. \n\nFor years, traders have borrowed money in Japan, where interest rates are low, and then used that money to buy assets abroad.

After that dismal showing, the selloff quickly turned global.\n\nAustralia\'s S&P/ASX 200 fell 3.7% on Monday, and Europe’s STOXX 600 dropped 2.17% after recovering some of its early losses. In the U.S., all three major market indices sank more than 2.5%, with mounting recession fears taking the blame for the collapse after a less-than-stellar July jobs report <https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/unemployment-hiring-jobs-report-july/> late last week. \n\nHowever, there were a number of root causes—and reinforcing drivers—that combined to create global market mayhem on Monday.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/5-reasons-stocks-down-global-stock-market-rout/\n\nSource 2:\nSlowing job growth also led the unemployment rate to rise to 4.3% last month, from 4.1% in June. That rise triggered a key recession indicator called the Sahm Rule <https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/recession-indicator-claudia-sahm-rule-trigger-unemployment-rate-jobs-report/>, sparking fears about the U.S. economy’s stability and leading some to argue Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made a mistake by not cutting interest rates <https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/fed-powell-market-upset-september-rate-cut/> last month.\n\nThere was certainly evidence on Monday that traders were betting on a slowing economy and more Fed rate cuts this year, with Treasury yields tumbling.

The July employment report came in far weaker than anticipated last week, with the U.S. economy adding 114,000 jobs, compared to economists’ consensus forecast for 175,000. The unemployment also rose to 4.3%, triggering one of the most accurate recession indicators, the infamous Sahm Rule.\n\n“The immediate implication is that investors fear that the economy may weaken rapidly and want the Fed to cut rates aggressively to maintain economic growth,” Wells Fargo’s Christopher explained. \n\nHowever, the global stock market rout began in Japan on Monday, where the Nikkei 225 plunged 12% in its worst day since 1987. And some say the so-called “carry trade” may be to blame for Japan’s dark Monday. \n\nFor years, traders have borrowed money in Japan, where interest rates are low, and then used that money to buy assets abroad. But with the Bank of Japan now raising interest rates last week, and most Western nations lowering interest rates, that trade isn’t what it used to be.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/global-stock-market-vix-fear-gauge-highest-level-2020/\n\nSource 2:\nMonday was a dark day for stock market investors worldwide. \n\nThe pain started in Asia, where Japan’s Nikkei 225 cratered more than 12% in its worst day since 1987, while South Korea’s KOSPI sank over 8%, forcing a brief mid-day trading halt. After that dismal showing, the selloff quickly turned global.\n\nAustralia\'s S&P/ASX 200 fell 3.7% on Monday, and Europe’s STOXX 600 dropped 2.17% after recovering some of its early losses. In the U.S., all three major market indices sank more than 2.5%, with mounting recession fears taking the blame for the collapse after a less-than-stellar July jobs report <https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/unemployment-hiring-jobs-report-july/> late last week. \n\nHowever, there were a number of root causes—and reinforcing drivers—that combined to create global market mayhem on Monday.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/5-reasons-stocks-down-global-stock-market-rout/\n\nSource 2:\nSlowing job growth also led the unemployment rate to rise to 4.3% last month, from 4.1% in June. That rise triggered a key recession indicator called the Sahm Rule <https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/recession-indicator-claudia-sahm-rule-trigger-unemployment-rate-jobs-report/>, sparking fears about the U.S. economy’s stability and leading some to argue Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made a mistake by not cutting interest rates <https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/fed-powell-market-upset-september-rate-cut/> last month.\n\nThere was certainly evidence on Monday that traders were betting on a slowing economy and more Fed rate cuts this year, with Treasury yields tumbling. Natixis Investment Managers Janasiewicz noted that the economic growth scare was widespread, too, which contributed to the global stock market rout.\n\n“Weaker global data is adding to the concerns with weak [purchasing manager indexes] out of Asia coupled with China stimulus hopes that are repeatedly dashed,” he said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/5-reasons-stocks-down-global-stock-market-rout/\n\nSource 3:\nStill, confidence in the global economy has strengthened this year, backed mainly by US growth and recent signs of a rebound in China <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-24/china-2024-growth-outlook-raised-to-4-8-deflation-risk-lingers>. Similarly, the International Monetary Fund this month raised its forecast <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-16/imf-lifts-growth-forecast-for-global-economy-but-warns-of-risks> for global economic expansion while a Bloomberg survey shows that euro zone growth is expected to pick up from 2025.\n\nWhile recent economic data reflected a sharp downshift in US economic growth <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-25/us-economy-expands-at-1-6-rate-trailing-all-forecasts> last quarter, these figures should be “taken with a grain of salt” as they disguise otherwise resilient demand, said David Mazza, chief executive officer at Roundhill Investments.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/28/stock-market-outlook-fed-rate-cuts-sp500-rally-earnings/\n\nSource 4:\nUpcoming U.S. elections <https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-harris-election-b8340b9b1025df7c729377794a6a3131> could further scramble things: apart from the potential impact of policies that follow the vote, market gyrations could affect the election itself.\n\nA recession would likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive, but slower growth would sap inflation. That would oblige former President Donald Trump to focus on ways to revive the economy instead of focusing on higher prices.\n\nThe Bank of Japan’s move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero <https://apnews.com/article/japan-economy-rates-boj-yen-e00919b053412fabf7a800ed78a9ad7a> last week was another factor driving Monday\'s plunge in Tokyo. Higher rates can boost the value of the Japanese yen, but oblige traders to scramble out of deals where they had borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nOn Tuesday, the dollar was worth 145.33 yen, up from 144.17 yen late Monday.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/08/06/japan-nikkei-index-recovers-from-worst-plunge-since-1987/\n\nSource 5:\nThe whiplash moves for financial markets globally have been the result of several technical factors, not just worries ignited by several weaker-than-expected <https://apnews.com/article/economy-jobs-unemployment-federal-reserve-inflation-22095766804d9c1532b4fcc29565be49> reports on the U.S. economy, in what strategists at Barclays <https://fortune.com/company/barclays/> called “a perfect storm” for causing extreme market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds <https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-carry-japan-currency-9611229d14e547e11f7e0299f2a6d00a> and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan <https://apnews.com/article/japan-economy-rates-boj-yen-e00919b053412fabf7a800ed78a9ad7a> made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.\n\nThat scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits from those investments may have helped accelerate the declines for markets around the world.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/wall-street-rebounds-as-sp-500-ends-3-day-slump/\n\nSource 6:\n"We’ve gone into recession with all different levels of unemployment," she explained. "These dynamics feed on themselves. If people lose their jobs, they stop spending, [and] more people lose jobs."\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street has had a more sanguine view of the economy, citing last year\'s widespread recession predictions that proved wrong as well as the AI boom that\'s helping to fuel a wave of investment and earnings growth.\n\nLast month, Neuberger Berman senior portfolio manager Steve Eisman also pointed to the boost in infrastructure spending.\n\n“We’re just powering through, and I think the only conclusion you can reach is that the U.S. economy is more dynamic than it’s ever been in its history,” he told CNBC <https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/13/big-short-investor-steve-eisman-the-u-s-economy-is-more-dynamic-than-its-ever-been.html>.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/recession-indicator-economic-outlook-sahm-rule-unemployment-rate-june-jobs-report/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/recession-indicator-economic-outlook-sahm-rule-unemployment-rate-june-jobs-report/\n\nSource 7:\nThe economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia’s shutdown in natural gas supplies after the invasion of Ukraine, as well as feeble Chinese demand and the car industry’s difficulties  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-05/vw-factory-closures-symbolic-moment-in-germany-s-industrial-decline>in pivoting to electric vehicles.\n\n“Currently, production in the automotive industry fluctuates considerably from month to month and this has an impact on the monthly development of production in industry as a whole,” Destatis said <https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2024/10/PE24_383_421.html>.\n\nThe Bundesbank said last month that gross domestic product may have stagnated <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-19/germany-may-already-be-in-mild-recession-bundesbank-says> or fallen in the third quarter, following a slight drop in the prior three months.

This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

2024-11-08 06:40:36,894: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In

2024-11-08 06:40:37,119: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected

2024-11-08 06:40:37,501: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with

2024-11-08 06:40:37,673: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate,

2024-11-08 06:40:37,901: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken

2024-11-08 06:40:38,408: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why do economic recessions occur?

2024-11-08 06:40:38,408: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient

2024-11-08 06:40:38,780: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in

2024-11-08 06:40:38,994: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why do economic recessions occur?

2024-11-08 06:40:38,994: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example

2024-11-08 06:40:39,172: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has

In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia

2024-11-08 06:40:39,648: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why do economic recessions occur?

2024-11-08 06:40:39,648: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [

2024-11-08 06:40:39,772: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

2024-11-08 06:40:40,151: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

Global events and economic policies can also play a role in triggering a

2024-11-08 06:40:40,332: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

Global events and economic policies can also play a role in triggering a recession. For instance, the Bank of Japan's decision to

2024-11-08 06:40:40,514: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why do economic recessions occur?

2024-11-08 06:40:40,514: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

Global events and economic policies can also play a role in triggering a recession. For instance, the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates above virtually zero led to

However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

Global events and economic policies can also play a role in triggering a recession. For instance, the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates above virtually zero led to a scramble out of deals where investors had

2024-11-08 06:40:40,633: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3].

2024-11-08 06:40:40,800: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why do economic recessions occur?

2024-11-08 06:40:40,800: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

Global events and economic policies can also play a role in triggering a recession. For instance, the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates above virtually zero led to a scramble out of deals where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around

Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

Global events and economic policies can also play a role in triggering a recession. For instance, the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates above virtually zero led to a scramble out of deals where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world, contributing to a global

2024-11-08 06:40:41,129: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3].

2024-11-08 06:40:41,258: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why do economic recessions occur?

2024-11-08 06:40:41,258: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

Global events and economic policies can also play a role in triggering a recession. For instance, the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates above virtually zero led to a scramble out of deals where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world, contributing to a global market rout [5]. Furthermore, trade tensions

2024-11-08 06:40:41,422: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why do economic recessions occur?

2024-11-08 06:40:41,422: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

Global events and economic policies can also play a role in triggering a recession. For instance, the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates above virtually zero led to a scramble out of deals where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world, contributing to a global market rout [5]. Furthermore, trade tensions and declining exports can also contribute to a

2024-11-08 06:40:41,542: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why do economic recessions occur?

2024-11-08 06:40:41,542: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

Global events and economic policies can also play a role in triggering a recession. For instance, the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates above virtually zero led to a scramble out of deals where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world, contributing to a global market rout [5]. Furthermore, trade tensions and declining exports can also contribute to a recession. In the case

2024-11-08 06:40:41,705: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why do economic recessions occur?

2024-11-08 06:40:41,705: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

Global events and economic policies can also play a role in triggering a recession. For instance, the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates above virtually zero led to a scramble out of deals where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world, contributing to a global market rout [5]. Furthermore, trade tensions and declining exports can also contribute to a recession. In the case of Germany, the country's exports to its biggest trading partner

2024-11-08 06:40:41,821: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why do economic recessions occur?

2024-11-08 06:40:41,821: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

Global events and economic policies can also play a role in triggering a recession. For instance, the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates above virtually zero led to a scramble out of deals where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world, contributing to a global market rout [5]. Furthermore, trade tensions and declining exports can also contribute to a recession. In the case of Germany, the country's exports to its biggest trading partner, China, have declined sharply, contributing

For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

Global events and economic policies can also play a role in triggering a recession. For instance, the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates above virtually zero led to a scramble out of deals where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world, contributing to a global market rout [5]. Furthermore, trade tensions and declining exports can also contribute to a recession. In the case of Germany, the country's exports to its biggest trading partner, China, have declined sharply, contributing to its economic decline [

2024-11-08 06:40:41,939: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Why do economic recessions occur?

2024-11-08 06:40:41,939: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].

A decline in economic growth can also contribute to a recession. In the case of the US economy, recent data reflected a sharp downshift in economic growth, with the economy expanding at a 1.6% rate, trailing all forecasts [3]. However, some experts argue that this data should be "taken with a grain of salt" as it disguises otherwise resilient demand [3]. Additionally, a decline in industrial production can also contribute to a recession. For example, in Germany, the economy has been weighed down by the weakness of its industrial sector amid Russia's shutdown in natural gas supplies and feeble Chinese demand [7].

Global events and economic policies can also play a role in triggering a recession. For instance, the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates above virtually zero led to a scramble out of deals where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world, contributing to a global market rout [5]. Furthermore, trade tensions and declining exports can also contribute to a recession. In the case of Germany, the country's exports to its biggest trading partner, China, have declined sharply, contributing to its economic decline [9].
