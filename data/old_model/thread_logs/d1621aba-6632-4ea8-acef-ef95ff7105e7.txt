When, by a unique, bold decision, one eastern private college raised its tuition fee to substantially 100% of the cost of teaching, it simultaneously notified parents that acceptable students could get grants-in-aid (discounts, in effect) if their families could not pay in full. One father thereupon entered his daughter in a neighboring college, haughtily declaring that he wanted no charity. But the neighbor\'s tuition charge, which Daddy proudly paid "in full," was almost $400 under cost. U.S. higher education is, in fact, an enormous charity. Though board and lodging are usually charged for at cost, an insignificant number -- possibly none -- of the three million students, even at the most expensive institutions, pay the full cost of their instruction proper (at the exceptional college cited above, costs have since overtaken fees once again). All get a standard discount, its size depending on the local cost level, the institution\'s wealth, and how eager the institution is to attract talented students who may lack the cash to pay full costs.

Clarence H. Faust, formerly a dean at the University of Chicago and now both president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education and vice president in charge of education for the Ford Foundation, has outlined a plan that would give students an assignment to study independently off the campus for one-quarter of each year. This would increase the number a given plant could handle. Would the system detract from the quality of education? Dr. Faust believes not. "The pressure of numbers may be the occasion for important improvements in college education," he says. Dr. Faust rejects the old assumption that the only way to learn is in a group, taking a formal course. Many educators agree that U.S. college students show inadequate initiative because they are conditioned in high school to study only specific assignments, and are brought up "in the lock step of class lectures, recitations, deadlines for papers and reports, and course examinations." Dr. Faust would reduce student-teacher contact. This could be done by having students spend several months working on their own, after a month or so of lectures that would identify the nature of problems involved in a given subject and would indicate how "a sharp,', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.6407559), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='c047e342-5cd2-4016-a245-0e4a00d183d9', embedding=None, metadata={'id': '6e919a176390e73a2982d13b545f74553df5249a43ef430aacadc5a9abd8e88a-28', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': '6e919a176390e73a2982d13b545f74553df5249a43ef430aacadc5a9abd8e88a', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 19570901, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-08', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fortune-logo-1600x900-white.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 1957, 'date_month': 9, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 1, 'title': 'Colleges are too cheap', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='This story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/>', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.6379562), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='500ba8de-893c-48a1-8a1b-8ea3419fab0c', embedding=None, metadata={'id': '6e919a176390e73a2982d13b545f74553df5249a43ef430aacadc5a9abd8e88a-25', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': '6e919a176390e73a2982d13b545f74553df5249a43ef430aacadc5a9abd8e88a', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 19570901, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-08', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fortune-logo-1600x900-white.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 1957, 'date_month': 9, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 1, 'title': 'Colleges are too cheap', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='and administered professionally.

Were such a plan widely used, employers would undoubtedly come around to aiding employees with repayment commitments." Some business judgments In recent years Fortune has referred to the views of other advocates of massive credit for higher education. One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, "Study now, pay later," but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry. He contends that a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it. He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where "the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive."

Of late the share of total enrollment enjoyed by private institutions has fallen from 50.3% (average for 1947- 51) to 42.9% (1956). It is assumed that a continuation of this trend would weaken the role of private institutions in maintaining standards for the entire system of higher education, and that it is desirable to find ways and means for the substantial expansion of the private schools. 2. Higher education has demonstrated its economic value to the individual. On the other hand, the social need for people with higher education, however great in an atomic and automatic age, is finite; In selecting students, tests of motivation, including charging a fee, are therefore relevant; not everybody has to go to college. The important question about fees is not whether, but how much. The hunt for dollars The fees that students paid for their instruction in fiscal 1957 were on the average at least double what they were in 1940. But such fees, totaling about $1 billion, still covered only one-third of the costs of the instruction.

Perhaps the most radical pedagogical suggestion is the use of television, which the Fund for the Advancement of Education has been pushing assiduously.

Such a change from traditional policy might endanger democratic education and deprive campuses of much fine talent-unless the change were linked to the expansion of financial aid to needy students. Even now about 200,000 of the most able high-school graduates annually renounce higher education, often for financial reasons. So, while such innovations as higher fees are debated, there is increased emphasis on getting more revenue from other sources. Presumably the ceiling on alumni giving has not been reached. At present only 20% of alumni respond to solicitation, so there is a large untapped source. Yale's annual take from alumni has risen from $509,000 in 1949 to $1,737,000, an increase of 240%; Yale is now aiming at $2 million a year. Almost every institution will intensify its alumni drives. While the economy expands, corporations will increase their giving. Last year corporations made tax-deductible philanthropic contributions of all kinds to the amount of almost $550 million, or 1.26% of their profit before taxes (as against the 5% that the income-tax law encourages them to give).

Some business judgments In recent years FORTUNE has referred to the views of other advocates of massive credit for higher education. One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, "Study now, pay later," but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry. He contends that a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it. He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where "the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive." Van den Haag would have the colleges lend to, or as he sees it, invest in students after raising capital by selling bonds, or simply endorse students\' notes and rediscount them.

Clarence H. Faust, formerly a dean at the University of Chicago and now both president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education and vice president in charge of education for the Ford Foundation, has outlined a plan that would give students an assignment to study independently off the campus for one-quarter of each year. This would increase the number a given plant could handle. Would the system detract from the quality of education? Dr. Faust believes not. "The pressure of numbers may be the occasion for important improvements in college education," he says. Dr. Faust rejects the old assumption that the only way to learn is in a group, taking a formal course. Many educators agree that U.S. college students show inadequate initiative because they are conditioned in high school to study only specific assignments, and are brought up "in the lock step of class lectures, recitations, deadlines for papers and reports, and course examinations." Dr. Faust would reduce student-teacher contact.

TV can effectively present not only uniquely talented lecturers to students anywhere, but also a wide range of audio-visual materials, including costly equipment, art originals, operational techniques in surgery, engineering, etc. Three years of experiment at Pennsylvania State showed that in many subjects TV students somewhat surpassed those taught conventionally. The great giveaway But the U.S. higher-education budget will never be balanced by savings on housekeeping and teaching costs. And since charity -- generous as it is -- has fallen short, has its limits, and is an unpredictable source, serious consideration is being given to the controversial idea of charging students the full cost of instruction.

So, while such innovations as higher fees are debated, there is increased emphasis on getting more revenue from other sources. Presumably the ceiling on alumni giving has not been reached.

Some business judgments In recent years Fortune has referred to the views of other advocates of massive credit for higher education. One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, "Study now, pay later," but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry. He contends that a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it. He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where "the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive."

And since charity -- generous as it is -- has fallen short, has its limits, and is an unpredictable source, serious consideration is being given to the controversial idea of charging students the full cost of instruction.

Retroactive scholarships could be provided to cover educational debts of those who become teachers, preachers, or members of other poorly paid professions.

Such a change from traditional policy might endanger democratic education and deprive campuses of much fine talent-unless the change were linked to the expansion of financial aid to needy students. Even now about 200,000 of the most able high-school graduates annually renounce higher education, often for financial reasons. So, while such innovations as higher fees are debated, there is increased emphasis on getting more revenue from other sources. Presumably the ceiling on alumni giving has not been reached. At present only 20% of alumni respond to solicitation, so there is a large untapped source. Yale's annual take from alumni has risen from $509,000 in 1949 to $1,737,000, an increase of 240%; Yale is now aiming at $2 million a year. Almost every institution will intensify its alumni drives. While the economy expands, corporations will increase their giving. Last year corporations made tax-deductible philanthropic contributions of all kinds to the amount of almost $550 million, or 1.26% of their profit before taxes (as against the 5% that the income-tax law encourages them to give).

Some business judgments In recent years FORTUNE has referred to the views of other advocates of massive credit for higher education. One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, "Study now, pay later," but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry. He contends that a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it. He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where "the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive." Van den Haag would have the colleges lend to, or as he sees it, invest in students after raising capital by selling bonds, or simply endorse students\' notes and rediscount them.

"The pressure of numbers may be the occasion for important improvements in college education," he says. Dr. Faust rejects the old assumption that the only way to learn is in a group, taking a formal course. Many educators agree that U.S. college students show inadequate initiative because they are conditioned in high school to study only specific assignments, and are brought up "in the lock step of class lectures, recitations, deadlines for papers and reports, and course examinations." Dr. Faust would reduce student-teacher contact. This could be done by having students spend several months working on their own, after a month or so of lectures that would identify the nature of problems involved in a given subject and would indicate how "a sharp, sensitive, well-disciplined mind" goes to work on the problems.

Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, "Study now, pay later," but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry.

Of late the share of total enrollment enjoyed by private institutions has fallen from 50.3% (average for 1947- 51) to 42.9% (1956). It is assumed that a continuation of this trend would weaken the role of private institutions in maintaining standards for the entire system of higher education, and that it is desirable to find ways and means for the substantial expansion of the private schools. 2. Higher education has demonstrated its economic value to the individual. On the other hand, the social need for people with higher education, however great in an atomic and automatic age, is finite; In selecting students, tests of motivation, including charging a fee, are therefore relevant; not everybody has to go to college. The important question about fees is not whether, but how much. The hunt for dollars The fees that students paid for their instruction in fiscal 1957 were on the average at least double what they were in 1940. But such fees, totaling about $1 billion, still covered only one-third of the costs of the instruction. The major financial problem, how to make up the difference, becomes more and more aggravated as the student body expands. Can it be solved by expansion of sources of revenue\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 1:\nthat would identify the nature of problems involved in a given subject and would indicate how "a sharp, sensitive, well-disciplined mind" goes to work on the problems. A related reform would be to reduce the highly inflated number of courses offered. Together, such reforms would dilute the present average twelve-to-one student-teacher ratio, and so conserve faculty labor. Perhaps the most radical pedagogical suggestion is the use of television, which the Fund for the Advancement of Education has been pushing assiduously. TV can effectively present not only uniquely talented lecturers to students anywhere, but also a wide range of audio-visual materials, including costly equipment, art originals, operational techniques in surgery, engineering, etc. Three years of experiment at Pennsylvania State showed that in many subjects TV students somewhat surpassed those taught conventionally. The great giveaway But the U.S. higher-education budget will never be balanced by savings on housekeeping and teaching costs. And since charity -- generous as it is -- has fallen short, has its limits, and is an unpredictable source, serious consideration is being given to the controversial idea of charging students the full cost of instruction. That students get a great deal for nothing is not generally appreciated. When, by a unique, bold decision, one eastern\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 1:\nCo., finds "obvious advantages to all concerned in borrowing toward an education." Josephs argues: "If all students capable of winning admission to an institution could have access to loans, irrespective of capacity to win scholarships, pressure would be removed when most appropriate and responsibility and independence promoted. " The committee itself has suggested that private foundations do something about "creating new regional or national mechanisms for supplying credit to students through their colleges at low interest and on flexible repayment terms." Who will borrow? There might well be many lenders and borrowers. College training today is quite another commodity from that dispensed in early U.S. colleges, which were set up primarily to produce preachers and teachers, whom society, then as now, esteemed but underpaid. Today a college education is an investment that adds an average of $100,000 to graduates\' lifetime earnings. Retroactive scholarships could be provided to cover educational debts of those who become teachers, preachers, or members of other poorly paid professions. Princeton University has some scholarships of this type now, and some states with programs of teacher-training tuition loans forgive the debt in return for teaching service after graduation. Women, too, might present a special problem since they seem convinced that men would not be anxious to marry debt-encumbered college\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 1:\ninstruction costs. Such a change from traditional policy might endanger democratic education and deprive campuses of much fine talent-unless the change were linked to the expansion of financial aid to needy students. Even now about 200,000 of the most able high-school graduates annually renounce higher education, often for financial reasons. So, while such innovations as higher fees are debated, there is increased emphasis on getting more revenue from other sources. Presumably the ceiling on alumni giving has not been reached. At present only 20% of alumni respond to solicitation, so there is a large untapped source. Yale\'s annual take from alumni has risen from $509,000 in 1949 to $1,737,000, an increase of 240%; Yale is now aiming at $2 million a year. Almost every institution will intensify its alumni drives. While the economy expands, corporations will increase their giving. Last year corporations made tax-deductible philanthropic contributions of all kinds to the amount of almost $550 million, or 1.26% of their profit before taxes (as against the 5% that the income-tax law encourages them to give). Perhaps they will never give 5%, but educators hope that as more and more corporations adopt philanthropic policies for a\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 2:\nreturn on the philanthropically contributed capital.

A related reform would be to reduce the highly inflated number of courses offered. Together, such reforms would dilute the present average twelve-to-one student-teacher ratio, and so conserve faculty labor. Perhaps the most radical pedagogical suggestion is the use of television, which the Fund for the Advancement of Education has been pushing assiduously. TV can effectively present not only uniquely talented lecturers to students anywhere, but also a wide range of audio-visual materials, including costly equipment, art originals, operational techniques in surgery, engineering, etc. Three years of experiment at Pennsylvania State showed that in many subjects TV students somewhat surpassed those taught conventionally. The great giveaway But the U.S. higher-education budget will never be balanced by savings on housekeeping and teaching costs. And since charity -- generous as it is -- has fallen short, has its limits, and is an unpredictable source, serious consideration is being given to the controversial idea of charging students the full cost of instruction. That students get a great deal for nothing is not generally appreciated. When, by a unique, bold decision, one eastern\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 1:\nCo., finds "obvious advantages to all concerned in borrowing toward an education." Josephs argues: "If all students capable of winning admission to an institution could have access to loans, irrespective of capacity to win scholarships, pressure would be removed when most appropriate and responsibility and independence promoted. " The committee itself has suggested that private foundations do something about "creating new regional or national mechanisms for supplying credit to students through their colleges at low interest and on flexible repayment terms." Who will borrow? There might well be many lenders and borrowers. College training today is quite another commodity from that dispensed in early U.S. colleges, which were set up primarily to produce preachers and teachers, whom society, then as now, esteemed but underpaid. Today a college education is an investment that adds an average of $100,000 to graduates\' lifetime earnings. Retroactive scholarships could be provided to cover educational debts of those who become teachers, preachers, or members of other poorly paid professions. Princeton University has some scholarships of this type now, and some states with programs of teacher-training tuition loans forgive the debt in return for teaching service after graduation. Women, too, might present a special problem since they seem convinced that men would not be anxious to marry debt-encumbered college\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 1:\ninstruction costs. Such a change from traditional policy might endanger democratic education and deprive campuses of much fine talent-unless the change were linked to the expansion of financial aid to needy students. Even now about 200,000 of the most able high-school graduates annually renounce higher education, often for financial reasons. So, while such innovations as higher fees are debated, there is increased emphasis on getting more revenue from other sources. Presumably the ceiling on alumni giving has not been reached. At present only 20% of alumni respond to solicitation, so there is a large untapped source. Yale\'s annual take from alumni has risen from $509,000 in 1949 to $1,737,000, an increase of 240%; Yale is now aiming at $2 million a year. Almost every institution will intensify its alumni drives. While the economy expands, corporations will increase their giving. Last year corporations made tax-deductible philanthropic contributions of all kinds to the amount of almost $550 million, or 1.26% of their profit before taxes (as against the 5% that the income-tax law encourages them to give). Perhaps they will never give 5%, but educators hope that as more and more corporations adopt philanthropic policies for a\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 2:\nreturn on the philanthropically contributed capital.

Some business judgments In recent years FORTUNE has referred to the views of other advocates of massive credit for higher education. One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, "Study now, pay later," but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry. He contends that a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it. He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where "the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive." Van den Haag would have the colleges lend to, or as he sees it, invest in students after raising capital by selling bonds, or simply endorse students\' notes and rediscount them. He argues the colleges would then "have an incentive\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-1957/\n\nSource 2:\nsimultaneously notified parents that acceptable students could get grants-in-aid (discounts, in effect) if their families could not pay in full. One father thereupon entered his daughter in a neighboring college, haughtily declaring that he wanted no charity.

Moreover, the many worthy students who find that the discounted tuition fee is still too high for them seek and often get an extra discount in the way of\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-1957/\n\nSource 2:\nthe Advancement of Education and vice president in charge of education for the Ford Foundation, has outlined a plan that would give students an assignment to study independently off the campus for one-quarter of each year.

Of late the share of total enrollment enjoyed by private institutions has fallen from 50.3% (average for 1947- 51) to 42.9% (1956). It is assumed that a continuation of this trend would weaken the role of private institutions in maintaining standards for the entire system of higher education, and that it is desirable to find ways and means for the substantial expansion of the private schools. 2. Higher education has demonstrated its economic value to the individual. On the other hand, the social need for people with higher education, however great in an atomic and automatic age, is finite; In selecting students, tests of motivation, including charging a fee, are therefore relevant; not everybody has to go to college. The important question about fees is not whether, but how much.

Clarence H. Faust, formerly a dean at the University of Chicago and now both president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education and vice president in charge of education for the Ford Foundation, has outlined a plan that would give students an assignment to study independently off the campus for one-quarter of each year. This would increase the number a given plant could handle. Would the system detract from the quality of education? Dr. Faust believes not. "The pressure of numbers may be the occasion for important improvements in college education," he says. Dr. Faust rejects the old assumption that the only way to learn is in a group, taking a formal course. Many educators agree that U.S. college students show inadequate initiative because they are conditioned in high school to study only specific assignments, and are brought up "in the lock step of class lectures, recitations, deadlines for papers and reports, and course examinations." Dr. Faust would reduce student-teacher contact. This could be done by having students spend several months working on their own, after a month or so of lectures that would identify the nature of problems involved in a given subject and would indicate how "a sharp,\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 1:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 1:\nand administered professionally.

Some business judgments In recent years Fortune has referred to the views of other advocates of massive credit for higher education. One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, "Study now, pay later," but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry. He contends that a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it. He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where "the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive."

Of late the share of total enrollment enjoyed by private institutions has fallen from 50.3% (average for 1947- 51) to 42.9% (1956). It is assumed that a continuation of this trend would weaken the role of private institutions in maintaining standards for the entire system of higher education, and that it is desirable to find ways and means for the substantial expansion of the private schools. 2. Higher education has demonstrated its economic value to the individual. On the other hand, the social need for people with higher education, however great in an atomic and automatic age, is finite; In selecting students, tests of motivation, including charging a fee, are therefore relevant; not everybody has to go to college. The important question about fees is not whether, but how much. The hunt for dollars The fees that students paid for their instruction in fiscal 1957 were on the average at least double what they were in 1940. But such fees, totaling about $1 billion, still covered only one-third of the costs of the instruction. The major financial problem, how to make up the difference, becomes more and more aggravated as the student body expands. Can it be solved by expansion of sources of revenue\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 1:\nthat would identify the nature of problems involved in a given subject and would indicate how "a sharp, sensitive, well-disciplined mind" goes to work on the problems. A related reform would be to reduce the highly inflated number of courses offered. Together, such reforms would dilute the present average twelve-to-one student-teacher ratio, and so conserve faculty labor. Perhaps the most radical pedagogical suggestion is the use of television, which the Fund for the Advancement of Education has been pushing assiduously. TV can effectively present not only uniquely talented lecturers to students anywhere, but also a wide range of audio-visual materials, including costly equipment, art originals, operational techniques in surgery, engineering, etc. Three years of experiment at Pennsylvania State showed that in many subjects TV students somewhat surpassed those taught conventionally. The great giveaway But the U.S. higher-education budget will never be balanced by savings on housekeeping and teaching costs. And since charity -- generous as it is -- has fallen short, has its limits, and is an unpredictable source, serious consideration is being given to the controversial idea of charging students the full cost of instruction. That students get a great deal for nothing is not generally appreciated. When, by a unique, bold decision, one eastern\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 1:\nCo., finds "obvious advantages to all concerned in borrowing toward an education." Josephs argues: "If all students capable of winning admission to an institution could have access to loans, irrespective of capacity to win scholarships, pressure would be removed when most appropriate and responsibility and independence promoted. " The committee itself has suggested that private foundations do something about "creating new regional or national mechanisms for supplying credit to students through their colleges at low interest and on flexible repayment terms." Who will borrow? There might well be many lenders and borrowers. College training today is quite another commodity from that dispensed in early U.S. colleges, which were set up primarily to produce preachers and teachers, whom society, then as now, esteemed but underpaid. Today a college education is an investment that adds an average of $100,000 to graduates\' lifetime earnings. Retroactive scholarships could be provided to cover educational debts of those who become teachers, preachers, or members of other poorly paid professions. Princeton University has some scholarships of this type now, and some states with programs of teacher-training tuition loans forgive the debt in return for teaching service after graduation. Women, too, might present a special problem since they seem convinced that men would not be anxious to marry debt-encumbered college\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 1:\ninstruction costs. Such a change from traditional policy might endanger democratic education and deprive campuses of much fine talent-unless the change were linked to the expansion of financial aid to needy students. Even now about 200,000 of the most able high-school graduates annually renounce higher education, often for financial reasons. So, while such innovations as higher fees are debated, there is increased emphasis on getting more revenue from other sources. Presumably the ceiling on alumni giving has not been reached. At present only 20% of alumni respond to solicitation, so there is a large untapped source. Yale\'s annual take from alumni has risen from $509,000 in 1949 to $1,737,000, an increase of 240%; Yale is now aiming at $2 million a year. Almost every institution will intensify its alumni drives. While the economy expands, corporations will increase their giving. Last year corporations made tax-deductible philanthropic contributions of all kinds to the amount of almost $550 million, or 1.26% of their profit before taxes (as against the 5% that the income-tax law encourages them to give). Perhaps they will never give 5%, but educators hope that as more and more corporations adopt philanthropic policies for a\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/colleges-are-too-cheap-fortune-classics-1957/\n\nSource 2:\nreturn on the philanthropically contributed capital.

One father thereupon entered his daughter in a neighboring college, haughtily declaring that he wanted no charity.

2024-11-08 06:41:21,798: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs.

According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers

According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1].

2024-11-08 06:41:23,451: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally,

According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1].

According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1].

As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the

2024-11-08 06:41:23,911: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2

2024-11-08 06:41:24,056: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

2024-11-08 06:41:24,255: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

2024-11-08 06:41:24,530: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

2024-11-08 06:41:25,102: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore,

2024-11-08 06:41:25,506: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant

According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals

2024-11-08 06:41:26,239: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

2024-11-08 06:41:26,483: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3

2024-11-08 06:41:26,846: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3].

2024-11-08 06:41:26,981: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3]. Therefore, while making education free for everyone might be a complex and costly endeavor

2024-11-08 06:41:27,073: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3]. Therefore, while making education free for everyone might be a complex and costly endeavor, it could also have

2024-11-08 06:41:27,494: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What would happen if education was free for everyone?

2024-11-08 06:41:27,494: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3]. Therefore, while making education free for everyone might be a complex and costly endeavor, it could also have significant benefits for individuals and society as a whole.

Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3]. Therefore, while making education free for everyone might be a complex and costly endeavor, it could also have significant benefits for individuals and society as a whole.

2024-11-08 06:41:27,686: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3]. Therefore, while making education free for everyone might be a complex and costly endeavor, it could also have significant benefits for individuals and society as a whole.

2024-11-08 06:41:27,957: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What would happen if education was free for everyone?

2024-11-08 06:41:27,957: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3]. Therefore, while making education free for everyone might be a complex and costly endeavor, it could also have significant benefits for individuals and society as a whole.

2024-11-08 06:41:28,617: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3]. Therefore, while making education free for everyone might be a complex and costly endeavor, it could also have significant benefits for individuals and society as a whole.

Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3]. Therefore, while making education free for everyone might be a complex and costly endeavor, it could also have significant benefits for individuals and society as a whole.

2024-11-08 06:41:28,844: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

2024-11-08 06:41:28,952: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What would happen if education was free for everyone?

2024-11-08 06:41:28,952: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3]. Therefore, while making education free for everyone might be a complex and costly endeavor, it could also have significant benefits for individuals and society as a whole.

2024-11-08 06:41:29,172: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What would happen if education was free for everyone?

2024-11-08 06:41:29,172: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3]. Therefore, while making education free for everyone might be a complex and costly endeavor, it could also have significant benefits for individuals and society as a whole.

2024-11-08 06:41:29,501: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3]. Therefore, while making education free for everyone might be a complex and costly endeavor, it could also have significant benefits for individuals and society as a whole.

2024-11-08 06:41:29,623: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What would happen if education was free for everyone?

2024-11-08 06:41:29,623: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3]. Therefore, while making education free for everyone might be a complex and costly endeavor, it could also have significant benefits for individuals and society as a whole.

Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3]. Therefore, while making education free for everyone might be a complex and costly endeavor, it could also have significant benefits for individuals and society as a whole.

2024-11-08 06:41:29,790: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If education were free for everyone, it would likely have a significant impact on the education system and society as a whole. According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

According to Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman and educator, a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it [1]. This suggests that free education would lead to a more level playing field, where students from all backgrounds would have an equal chance to access higher education.

However, it's worth noting that making education free for everyone would also come with significant costs. As Dr. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, points out, the U.S. higher-education budget is already strained, and finding ways to balance it is a major challenge [1]. If education were free, the financial burden would likely fall on the government, taxpayers, or private institutions, which could be difficult to sustain. Additionally, some critics argue that free education might lead to a surge in enrollment, which could put pressure on the education system and compromise the quality of education [2].

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that making education more accessible and affordable is essential for creating a more educated and skilled workforce. As Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, suggests, a system of massive credit for higher education could help increase educational opportunity and equalize it [2]. Furthermore, research has shown that investing in education can have significant long-term benefits for individuals and society, including increased economic growth, improved health outcomes, and reduced poverty [3]. Therefore, while making education free for everyone might be a complex and costly endeavor, it could also have significant benefits for individuals and society as a whole.
