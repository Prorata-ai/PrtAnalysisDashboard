They underscore the importance of taking our national governments to court,” the 21-year-old Swede told the AP.\n\n“The first ruling by an international human rights court on the inadequacy of states’ climate action leaves no doubt," said Joie Chowdhury, senior attorney with the Center for International Environmental Law, "the climate crisis is a human rights crisis.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/04/10/swiss-women-win-the-first-ever-climate-case-victory-in-european-court-of-human-rights-greta-thunberg-switzerland/\n\nSource 2:\nA group called Senior Women for Climate Protection, whose average age is 74, had argued that they were particularly affected because older women are most vulnerable to the extreme heat that is becoming more frequent <https://apnews.com/article/climate-and-environment-natural-disasters-health-droughts-d71b96c3e57c7d7f1fbf0c03d8c3de76>.\n\n“The court recognized our fundamental right to a healthy climate and to have our country do what it failed to do until now: that is to say taking ambitious measures to protect our health and protect the future of all,” said Anne Mahrer, a member of the group.\n\nSwitzerland said it would study the decision to see what steps would be needed. “We have to, in good faith, implement and execute the judgment,” Alain Chablais, who represented the country at last year\'s hearings, told The Associated Press.\n\nJudge Siofra O’Leary, the court\'s president, stressed that it would be up to governments to decide how to approach climate change obligations — and experts noted that was a limit of the ruling.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/04/10/swiss-women-win-the-first-ever-climate-case-victory-in-european-court-of-human-rights-greta-thunberg-switzerland/\n\nSource 2:\nAlthough activists have had success with lawsuits in domestic proceedings, this was the first time an international court ruled on climate change — and the first decision confirming that countries have an obligation to protect people from its effects, according to Heri.\n\nShe said it would open the door to more legal challenges in the countries that are members of the Council of Europe, which includes the 27 EU nations as well as many others from Britain to Turkey.\n\nThe Swiss ruling softened the blow for those who lost Tuesday.\n\n“The most important thing is that the court has said in the Swiss women’s case that governments must cut their emissions more to protect human rights,” said 19-year-od Sofia Oliveira, one of the Portuguese plaintiffs. “Their win is a win for us, too, and a win for everyone!”\n\nThe court — which is unrelated to the European Union — ruled that Switzerland “had failed to comply with its duties” to combat climate change and meet emissions targets.\n\nThat, the court said, was a violation of the women’s rights, noting that the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees people “effective protection by the state authorities from the serious adverse effects of climate change on their lives, health, well-being and quality of life.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/04/10/swiss-women-win-the-first-ever-climate-case-victory-in-european-court-of-human-rights-greta-thunberg-switzerland/\n\nSource 3:\n“Climate change is the mother of all stealth taxes paid by everyday people and vulnerable countries and communities,” he said. “Meanwhile, the godfathers of climate chaos — the fossil fuel industry — rake in record profits and feast off trillions in taxpayer-funded subsidies."\n\nGuterres said that global emissions of carbon dioxide must fall 9% each year to 2030 for the 1.5 C-degree target under the Paris climate accords to be kept alive. But temperatures are “heading in the wrong direction,” he said: They rose 1 degree last year.\n\n“We are playing Russian roulette with the planet. We need an exit ramp off the highway to climate hell,” Guterres said, while adding: “The truth is, we have control of the wheel.”\n\n“This forecast is affirmation that the world has entered a climate where years that are as hot as 2023 should no longer be a surprise,” Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor at Stanford’s Doerr School of Sustainability, said in an email of the WMO forecast.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/climate-change-heat-records-windfall-taxes-paris-accords/\n\nSource 3:\nBut U.N. officials and nongovernmental groups acknowledge that the secretary-general has little power beyond the “bully pulpit” — his perch at the head of the world body — to stir people, governments and business to change.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/climate-change-heat-records-windfall-taxes-paris-accords/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/climate-change-heat-records-windfall-taxes-paris-accords/\n\nSource 3:\nMeanwhile, the U.N. weather agency predicted an 80% chance that average global temperatures will surpass the 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) target set in the landmark Paris climate accord of 2015.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization, or WMO, said that the global mean near-surface temperature for each year from 2024 to 2028 is expected to range between 1.1 and 1.9 degrees Celsius hotter than at the start of the industrial era.\n\nIt also estimated that there’s nearly a one-in-two chance—47%—that the average global temperatures over that timeframe could top 1.5 C, an increase from just under a one-in-three chance projected for the 2023-2027 span.\n\nGuterres spoke from the American Museum of Natural History in New York in a bid to revive focus on climate change at a time when many national elections, and conflict in places like Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan this year have seized much of the international spotlight.\n\nHe repeated concerns about subsidies paid out in many countries for fossil fuels, which help keep prices low for consumers.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/climate-change-heat-records-windfall-taxes-paris-accords/\n\nSource 4:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/30/winning-fight-climate-change-environment-economics/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/30/winning-fight-climate-change-environment-economics/\n\nSource 5:\nThe power plant rule “completes a historic grand slam” of major actions by the Biden administration to reduce carbon pollution, said David Doniger, a climate and clean energy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

The two laws, combined with executive branch actions, will put the country on a path to meet Biden\'s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, environmentalists say.\n\nThe climate law, which includes nearly $400 billion in spending to boost clean energy, will have ripple effects on the economy for years to come, said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resource Defense Council and a former Obama administration official.\n\nShe pushed back on complaints by industry and Republicans that the power plant rule is a continuation of an Obama-era “war on coal.″\n\n“It’s an attack on pollution,″ she said, adding that fossil fuels such as coal and oil are subject to the Clean Air Act “and need to be cleaned up.″\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/24/biden-green-blitz-environmental-rules-rush-overturned-new-congress-president/'}

When the latest climate talks concluded <https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/climate/cop28-climate-agreement.html> in December, stronger language calling for a phaseout of fossil fuels had been dropped, the agreement was not legally binding, and financial support for countries to move toward more renewable energy had not been addressed. Representatives of small island nations that are most at risk from rising seas said, “This process has failed us” <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/13/cop28-landmark-deal-agreed-to-transition-away-from-fossil-fuels> and pointed to the “litany of loopholes” in the agreement, saying it would fail to help avoid climate catastrophe.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/24/after-overshadowing-climate-talks-the-myth-of-circularity-looms-over-un-plastics-treaty-environment/\n\nSource 2:\nAs part of trying to meet climate goals, the European Union, which doesn’t include Switzerland, currently has a target to be climate-neutral by 2050 <https://apnews.com/article/europe-climate-climate-change-business-environment-and-nature-f30384a397a820da15cc800f3a1a489e>. Despite those efforts, the Earth shattered global annual heat records <https://apnews.com/article/heat-wave-flood-wildfire-smoke-climate-change-c36078efbcba515a4c67b7d9d0bbb9fd> in 2023 and flirted with the world’s agreed-upon warming threshold, Copernicus, a European climate agency, said in January.\n\nCelebrity climate activist Greta Thunberg was in the courtroom as the decision was announced. “These rulings are a call to action. They underscore the importance of taking our national governments to court,” the 21-year-old Swede told the AP.\n\n“The first ruling by an international human rights court on the inadequacy of states’ climate action leaves no doubt," said Joie Chowdhury, senior attorney with the Center for International Environmental Law, "the climate crisis is a human rights crisis.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/04/10/swiss-women-win-the-first-ever-climate-case-victory-in-european-court-of-human-rights-greta-thunberg-switzerland/\n\nSource 2:\nA group called Senior Women for Climate Protection, whose average age is 74, had argued that they were particularly affected because older women are most vulnerable to the extreme heat that is becoming more frequent <https://apnews.com/article/climate-and-environment-natural-disasters-health-droughts-d71b96c3e57c7d7f1fbf0c03d8c3de76>.\n\n“The court recognized our fundamental right to a healthy climate and to have our country do what it failed to do until now: that is to say taking ambitious measures to protect our health and protect the future of all,” said Anne Mahrer, a member of the group.\n\nSwitzerland said it would study the decision to see what steps would be needed. “We have to, in good faith, implement and execute the judgment,” Alain Chablais, who represented the country at last year\'s hearings, told The Associated Press.\n\nJudge Siofra O’Leary, the court\'s president, stressed that it would be up to governments to decide how to approach climate change obligations — and experts noted that was a limit of the ruling.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/04/10/swiss-women-win-the-first-ever-climate-case-victory-in-european-court-of-human-rights-greta-thunberg-switzerland/\n\nSource 2:\nAlthough activists have had success with lawsuits in domestic proceedings, this was the first time an international court ruled on climate change — and the first decision confirming that countries have an obligation to protect people from its effects, according to Heri.\n\nShe said it would open the door to more legal challenges in the countries that are members of the Council of Europe, which includes the 27 EU nations as well as many others from Britain to Turkey.\n\nThe Swiss ruling softened the blow for those who lost Tuesday.\n\n“The most important thing is that the court has said in the Swiss women’s case that governments must cut their emissions more to protect human rights,” said 19-year-od Sofia Oliveira, one of the Portuguese plaintiffs. “Their win is a win for us, too, and a win for everyone!”\n\nThe court — which is unrelated to the European Union — ruled that Switzerland “had failed to comply with its duties” to combat climate change and meet emissions targets.\n\nThat, the court said, was a violation of the women’s rights, noting that the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees people “effective protection by the state authorities from the serious adverse effects of climate change on their lives, health, well-being and quality of life.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/04/10/swiss-women-win-the-first-ever-climate-case-victory-in-european-court-of-human-rights-greta-thunberg-switzerland/\n\nSource 3:\n“Climate change is the mother of all stealth taxes paid by everyday people and vulnerable countries and communities,” he said. “Meanwhile, the godfathers of climate chaos — the fossil fuel industry — rake in record profits and feast off trillions in taxpayer-funded subsidies."\n\nGuterres said that global emissions of carbon dioxide must fall 9% each year to 2030 for the 1.5 C-degree target under the Paris climate accords to be kept alive. But temperatures are “heading in the wrong direction,” he said: They rose 1 degree last year.\n\n“We are playing Russian roulette with the planet. We need an exit ramp off the highway to climate hell,” Guterres said, while adding: “The truth is, we have control of the wheel.”\n\n“This forecast is affirmation that the world has entered a climate where years that are as hot as 2023 should no longer be a surprise,” Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor at Stanford’s Doerr School of Sustainability, said in an email of the WMO forecast.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/climate-change-heat-records-windfall-taxes-paris-accords/\n\nSource 3:\nBut U.N. officials and nongovernmental groups acknowledge that the secretary-general has little power beyond the “bully pulpit” — his perch at the head of the world body — to stir people, governments and business to change.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/climate-change-heat-records-windfall-taxes-paris-accords/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/climate-change-heat-records-windfall-taxes-paris-accords/\n\nSource 3:\nMeanwhile, the U.N. weather agency predicted an 80% chance that average global temperatures will surpass the 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) target set in the landmark Paris climate accord of 2015.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization, or WMO, said that the global mean near-surface temperature for each year from 2024 to 2028 is expected to range between 1.1 and 1.9 degrees Celsius hotter than at the start of the industrial era.\n\nIt also estimated that there’s nearly a one-in-two chance—47%—that the average global temperatures over that timeframe could top 1.5 C, an increase from just under a one-in-three chance projected for the 2023-2027 span.\n\nGuterres spoke from the American Museum of Natural History in New York in a bid to revive focus on climate change at a time when many national elections, and conflict in places like Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan this year have seized much of the international spotlight.\n\nHe repeated concerns about subsidies paid out in many countries for fossil fuels, which help keep prices low for consumers.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/climate-change-heat-records-windfall-taxes-paris-accords/\n\nSource 4:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/30/winning-fight-climate-change-environment-economics/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/30/winning-fight-climate-change-environment-economics/\n\nSource 5:\nThe power plant rule “completes a historic grand slam” of major actions by the Biden administration to reduce carbon pollution, said David Doniger, a climate and clean energy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The first and most important action was passage of the 2022 climate law, <https://apnews.com/article/technology-science-congress-climate-and-environment-f084d23d61ebb068068d4aa92c82fdbb> officially known as the Inflation Reduction Act, he said, followed by separate EPA rules targeting tailpipe emissions from cars <https://apnews.com/article/epa-electric-vehicles-emissions-limits-climate-biden-e6d581324af51294048df24269b5d20a> and trucks <https://apnews.com/article/epa-trucks-buses-emissions-climate-electric-vehicle-77da206eed5d1950993e18a6f4439254> and methane emissions <https://apnews.com/article/biden-methane-epa-climate-oil-gas-cop28-6d37e9da49944e9a8c0b08aeb3ddc73e> from oil\nfrom oil and gas drilling.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/biden-new-epa-rules/\n\nSource 6:\nThe report pointed to interest rates that are higher for longer periods, debt repayment challenges, continuing geopolitical tensions and climate risks <https://apnews.com/article/africa-farming-technologies-climate-change-e0edfba75053cad02097f2e5bfe528fd> especially for the world’s poorest countries and small island nations.\n\nMukherjee said inflation, which is down from its 2023 peak, is both “a symptom of the underlying fragility” of the global economy where it still lurks, “but also a cause for concern in its own right.”\n\n“We’ve seen that in some countries inflation continues to be high,” he said. “Globally, energy and food prices are inching upward in recent months, but I think a bit more insidious even is the persistence of inflation above the 2% central bank target in many developed countries.”\n\nThe U.N. forecast for 2024 is lower than those of both the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/17/un-world-economy-growth-report/\n\nSource 7:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/02/trump-harris-climate-change-energy-policy/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/02/trump-harris-climate-change-energy-policy/\n\nSource 8:\nStaying power on climate?\n\nGerrard and other experts said the climate law and the bipartisan infrastructure law <https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-congress-infrastructure-bill-signing-b5b8cca843133de060778f049861b144> passed in 2021 are more durable and will be harder for a future president to unwind. The two laws, combined with executive branch actions, will put the country on a path to meet Biden\'s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, environmentalists say.\n\nThe climate law, which includes nearly $400 billion in spending to boost clean energy, will have ripple effects on the economy for years to come, said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resource Defense Council and a former Obama administration official.\n\nShe pushed back on complaints by industry and Republicans that the power plant rule is a continuation of an Obama-era “war on coal.″\n\n“It’s an attack on pollution,″ she said, adding that fossil fuels such as coal and oil are subject to the Clean Air Act “and need to be cleaned up.″\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/24/biden-green-blitz-environmental-rules-rush-overturned-new-congress-president/'}

The agreement dropped stronger language calling for a phaseout of fossil fuels, was not legally binding, and did not address financial support for countries to transition to renewable energy [1]. Representatives of small island nations expressed disappointment, stating that "This process has failed us" and pointing out the "litany of loopholes" in the agreement that would fail to help avoid climate catastrophe [1].

2024-11-08 06:43:03,697: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The major outcome of the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP28, was an agreement that failed to meet the expectations of many, particularly those from small island nations who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The agreement dropped stronger language calling for a phaseout of fossil fuels, was not legally binding, and did not address financial support for countries to transition to renewable energy [1]. Representatives of small island nations expressed disappointment, stating that "This process has failed us" and pointing out the "litany of loopholes" in the agreement that would fail to help avoid climate catastrophe [1].

The outcome of COP28 was seen as a missed opportunity to take bold action on climate change, despite the urgent need for it. The European Union, for example, has set a target to be climate-neutral by 2050 [2], but the COP

2024-11-08 06:43:03,947: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The major outcome of the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP28, was an agreement that failed to meet the expectations of many, particularly those from small island nations who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The agreement dropped stronger language calling for a phaseout of fossil fuels, was not legally binding, and did not address financial support for countries to transition to renewable energy [1]. Representatives of small island nations expressed disappointment, stating that "This process has failed us" and pointing out the "litany of loopholes" in the agreement that would fail to help avoid climate catastrophe [1].

The outcome of COP28 was seen as a missed opportunity to take bold action on climate change, despite the urgent need for it. The European Union, for example, has set a target to be climate-neutral by 2050 [2], but the COP28 agreement did not reflect a similar level of ambition.

2024-11-08 06:43:04,939: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The major outcome of the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP28, was an agreement that failed to meet the expectations of many, particularly those from small island nations who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The agreement dropped stronger language calling for a phaseout of fossil fuels, was not legally binding, and did not address financial support for countries to transition to renewable energy [1]. Representatives of small island nations expressed disappointment, stating that "This process has failed us" and pointing out the "litany of loopholes" in the agreement that would fail to help avoid climate catastrophe [1].

The outcome of COP28 was seen as a missed opportunity to take bold action on climate change, despite the urgent need for it. The European Union, for example, has set a target to be climate-neutral by 2050 [2], but the COP28 agreement did not reflect a similar level of ambition. The lack of progress at COP28 was particularly concerning given the record-breaking heat experienced in 2023,

2024-11-08 06:43:05,066: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The major outcome of the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP28, was an agreement that failed to meet the expectations of many, particularly those from small island nations who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The agreement dropped stronger language calling for a phaseout of fossil fuels, was not legally binding, and did not address financial support for countries to transition to renewable energy [1]. Representatives of small island nations expressed disappointment, stating that "This process has failed us" and pointing out the "litany of loopholes" in the agreement that would fail to help avoid climate catastrophe [1].

The outcome of COP28 was seen as a missed opportunity to take bold action on climate change, despite the urgent need for it. The European Union, for example, has set a target to be climate-neutral by 2050 [2], but the COP28 agreement did not reflect a similar level of ambition. The lack of progress at COP28 was particularly concerning given the record-breaking heat experienced in 2023, which shattered global annual heat records [2].

Representatives of small island nations expressed disappointment, stating that "This process has failed us" and pointing out the "litany of loopholes" in the agreement that would fail to help avoid climate catastrophe [1].

The outcome of COP28 was seen as a missed opportunity to take bold action on climate change, despite the urgent need for it. The European Union, for example, has set a target to be climate-neutral by 2050 [2], but the COP28 agreement did not reflect a similar level of ambition. The lack of progress at COP28 was particularly concerning given the record-breaking heat experienced in 2023, which shattered global annual heat records [2].

2024-11-08 06:43:05,871: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The major outcome of the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP28, was an agreement that failed to meet the expectations of many, particularly those from small island nations who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The agreement dropped stronger language calling for a phaseout of fossil fuels, was not legally binding, and did not address financial support for countries to transition to renewable energy [1]. Representatives of small island nations expressed disappointment, stating that "This process has failed us" and pointing out the "litany of loopholes" in the agreement that would fail to help avoid climate catastrophe [1].

The outcome of COP28 was seen as a missed opportunity to take bold action on climate change, despite the urgent need for it. The European Union, for example, has set a target to be climate-neutral by 2050 [2], but the COP28 agreement did not reflect a similar level of ambition. The lack of progress at COP28 was particularly concerning given the record-breaking heat experienced in 2023, which shattered global annual heat records [2].

2024-11-08 06:43:06,120: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The major outcome of the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP28, was an agreement that failed to meet the expectations of many, particularly those from small island nations who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The agreement dropped stronger language calling for a phaseout of fossil fuels, was not legally binding, and did not address financial support for countries to transition to renewable energy [1]. Representatives of small island nations expressed disappointment, stating that "This process has failed us" and pointing out the "litany of loopholes" in the agreement that would fail to help avoid climate catastrophe [1].

The outcome of COP28 was seen as a missed opportunity to take bold action on climate change, despite the urgent need for it. The European Union, for example, has set a target to be climate-neutral by 2050 [2], but the COP28 agreement did not reflect a similar level of ambition. The lack of progress at COP28 was particularly concerning given the record-breaking heat experienced in 2023, which shattered global annual heat records [2].

The failure of COP28 to deliver a strong agreement highlights the challenges of international climate negotiations, where the interests of different countries and industries can hinder progress.

2024-11-08 06:43:06,280: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The major outcome of the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP28, was an agreement that failed to meet the expectations of many, particularly those from small island nations who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The agreement dropped stronger language calling for a phaseout of fossil fuels, was not legally binding, and did not address financial support for countries to transition to renewable energy [1]. Representatives of small island nations expressed disappointment, stating that "This process has failed us" and pointing out the "litany of loopholes" in the agreement that would fail to help avoid climate catastrophe [1].

The outcome of COP28 was seen as a missed opportunity to take bold action on climate change, despite the urgent need for it. The European Union, for example, has set a target to be climate-neutral by 2050 [2], but the COP28 agreement did not reflect a similar level of ambition. The lack of progress at COP28 was particularly concerning given the record-breaking heat experienced in 2023, which shattered global annual heat records [2].

The failure of COP28 to deliver a strong agreement highlights the challenges of international climate negotiations, where the interests of different countries and industries can hinder progress. As Greta Thunberg, a prominent climate activist, noted, "These rulings are a call to action. They underscore the importance of taking our national governments to court" [2]. The outcome

The European Union, for example, has set a target to be climate-neutral by 2050 [2], but the COP28 agreement did not reflect a similar level of ambition. The lack of progress at COP28 was particularly concerning given the record-breaking heat experienced in 2023, which shattered global annual heat records [2].

The failure of COP28 to deliver a strong agreement highlights the challenges of international climate negotiations, where the interests of different countries and industries can hinder progress. As Greta Thunberg, a prominent climate activist, noted, "These rulings are a call to action. They underscore the importance of taking our national governments to court" [2].

As Greta Thunberg, a prominent climate activist, noted, "These rulings are a call to action. They underscore the importance of taking our national governments to court" [2].

2024-11-08 06:43:06,574: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The major outcome of the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP28, was an agreement that failed to meet the expectations of many, particularly those from small island nations who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The agreement dropped stronger language calling for a phaseout of fossil fuels, was not legally binding, and did not address financial support for countries to transition to renewable energy [1]. Representatives of small island nations expressed disappointment, stating that "This process has failed us" and pointing out the "litany of loopholes" in the agreement that would fail to help avoid climate catastrophe [1].

The outcome of COP28 was seen as a missed opportunity to take bold action on climate change, despite the urgent need for it. The European Union, for example, has set a target to be climate-neutral by 2050 [2], but the COP28 agreement did not reflect a similar level of ambition.

2024-11-08 06:43:06,631: ObserveEventsHandler(  207): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd response: assistant: The major outcome of the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP28, was an agreement that failed to meet the expectations of many, particularly those from small island nations who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The agreement dropped stronger language calling for a phaseout of fossil fuels, was not legally binding, and did not address financial support for countries to transition to renewable energy [1]. Representatives of small island nations expressed disappointment, stating that "This process has failed us" and pointing out the "litany of loopholes" in the agreement that would fail to help avoid climate catastrophe [1].

The outcome of COP28 was seen as a missed opportunity to take bold action on climate change, despite the urgent need for it. The European Union, for example, has set a target to be climate-neutral by 2050 [2], but the COP28 agreement did not reflect a similar level of ambition. The lack of progress at COP28 was particularly concerning given the record-breaking heat experienced in 2023, which shattered global annual heat records [2].

The failure of COP28 to deliver a strong agreement highlights the challenges of international climate negotiations, where the interests of different countries and industries can hinder progress. As Greta Thunberg, a prominent climate activist, noted, "These rulings are a call to action. They underscore the importance of taking our national governments to court" [2]. The outcome of COP28 serves as a reminder of the need for continued advocacy and pressure on governments to take meaningful action on climate change.
