She recounted her career as a prosecutor, citing the sexual abuse of a childhood friend as the moment that inspired her to pursue that path with her law degree. She listed her victories as California\'s attorney general, taking on banks and cartels.

In a boost to her foreign policy chops since she last ran for president in 2020, Harris said she met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky five days before Vladimir Putin\'s invasion to help prepare the country for Russian aggression.

She has backed <https://time.com/6249434/kamala-harris-abortion-powerful-asset/> federal legislation that would guarantee a national right to abortion.\n\nHarris has also led the Biden administration\'s efforts to expand voting rights <https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/us/politics/kamala-voting-rights.html>, including helping craft legislation that was ultimately stymied in the Senate <https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/15/harris-voting-rights-push-527186>. \n\nA pro-business \'centrist\'\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/21/vice-president-kamala-harris-policy-record-platform/\n\nSource 3:\nHarris\' election as vice president four years ago marked a series of historic firsts, making her the highest-ranking female elected official in U.S. history as well as the highest elected Black and Asian official. \n\nBut Harris faces a challenge common to many vice presidents—of forging her own distinct identity after playing the No. 2. In a statement <https://x.com/EugeneDaniels2/status/1815115511794893193> on Sunday, Harris said she intends "to earn and win this nomination." \n\nDuring Biden\'s first term, the 59-year-old has taken on some of the Biden administration’s toughest assignments, from the U.S.-Mexico border <https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/06/kamala-harris-trump-attacks-biden/>, to abortion rights, <https://theweek.com/in-depth/1023057/kamala-harris-vice-presidential-track-record> to voting rights <https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/15/harris-voting-rights-push-527186>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/21/vice-president-kamala-harris-policy-record-platform/\n\nSource 3:\nHer record as California\'s attorney general could bolster her standing against Trump and appeal to moderate voters.\n\n"The business community, especially the tech/VC community are exhilarated over this choice," Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told Fortune via email. "She is a confirmed centrist and strong prosecutor of the rule of law. Business leaders are especially worried about Trump’s violation of the rule of law in favor of the law of rulers.”\nBut Harris has also received criticism for her approach to some hot-button issues, particularly on immigration. It took her months to visit the US-Mexico border, even after being tapped by Biden to spearhead the administration’s response to the crisis. Her trip to Guatemala and Mexico in March was overshadowed in the press by an interview <https://theweek.com/speed-reads/1001288/kamala-harris-defends-not-visiting-us-mexico-border-in-slightly-contentious> with Lester Holt of NBC News where she "awkwardly downplayed the urgency" of the visit, The Washington Post <https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/01/30/harris-democrats-worry> said.

"Voters are moving on from voting because of a historic first," says Brown. "Voters are more interested in thinking about how this person\'s historic first fits into the policies that they care about." We\'ve seen this from Harris in her campaigning on the issue of reproductive rights. With Roe v. Wade overturned (which was of course not the case in 2016), abortion is a key issue for Democratic voters. As vice president, Harris served as the Biden administration\'s key voice on reproductive rights <https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/harris-bold-abortion-stance-impact-2024-election-biden-exit-rcna163016> and she\'s continued that on the campaign trail. She\'s tapped into her intersecting identities, too, to connect with Black and Asian voters <https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-black-voters-e068b36f765cbaa711d1fab3d38769f1>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/13/kamala-harris-first-female-president-why-isnt-she-talking-about-it-more/\n\nSource 6:\nAs the AP points out <https://apnews.com/article/trump-black-journalists-convention-nabj-1e96aa530e88013ed6f577feaf89ccb6>, Harris\'s full identity has always been part of her political career. In the Senate, she was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Long before that, she attended the HBCU Howard University and pledged the historically Black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha. She\'s often referenced the influence her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, had on her upbringing, and during the 2020 election cycle her campaign included a stop making dosa <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz7rNOAFkgE&ab_channel=KamalaHarris> with fellow Indian-American Mindy Kaling.
