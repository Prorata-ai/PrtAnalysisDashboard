If you’re hungry after a 5:30 dinner before you go to bed, it might be too early for you. Consider testing out a 6:30 or 7 p.m. meal. \n * Avoid late-night snacking. Schmidt warns that eating an early dinner and then snacking late at night offsets the benefits: “We know that when people eat later at night, they have a higher risk of obesity.” \n * Plan ahead for the busy days. “I recognize that my kid has sports every Wednesday, so every Wednesday is going to be Crockpot Wednesday because we have to get in the house, change over, get them dinner, and get out again, as opposed to waiting until after practice,” Schmidt says. \nKeep in mind, experts have said <https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/25/best-time-to-eat-dinner/> that what is on your plate is still more important than when you eat. Half the plate should consist of non-starchy vegetables, a fourth should have lean protein, and another fourth should have a whole grain or starchy vegetable. \n\nFor more on healthy eating:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/early-dinner-time-improve-health/\n\nSource 1:\n“If you assume 5:30 p.m. is ‘too early’ for dinner, you might end up snacking on processed carbs like chips and crackers, which can lead to overeating,” Muhlstein says. \n\nIf you’re still hungry after an early dinner, don’t fret. You may consider adjusting the time you eat. If you need a snack, Schmidt recommends grabbing something high in water content, like easily digestible fruit, or a food high in fiber and protein to sustain fullness, like a whole grain. \n\nYou may lower your disease risk \n\nEating late at night has been associated with a higher overall calorie intake and an increased risk for obesity <https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(22)00397-7#%20>. One study suggests that the hormone responsible for feeling full, leptin A, decreases later in the day, which can lead to overeating when you have a late meal. Particularly for those with diabetes or obesity, eating earlier can also help with insulin sensitivity.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/early-dinner-time-improve-health/\n\nSource 1:\nThere are the night owls <https://fortune.com/well/2023/09/11/night-owls-unhealthy-lifestyle-habits-higher-risk-diabetes/> who refuse to turn the stove on until half past eight and eat out only when the late-night ambience draws in the crowds. Then there are those hangry ones who loathe a late dinner reservation and swear by an early meal well before the sun sets.

According to Resy <https://blog.resy.com/2022/05/5-p-m-is-the-new-8-p-m-at-new-york-restaurants-and-i-couldnt-be-happier/>, an online reservation platform, more people have been making reservations at 5:30 p.m. in New York City, and fewer people have been making them at 8 p.m. compared to years prior. Last year, the number of dinner reservations made before 5 p.m. doubled compared to 2019, according to Yelp <https://www.marketplace.org/2023/09/22/6-p-m-dinner-reservations-are-losing-their-stigma/>. Not to mention, an unintended benefit of the 5:30 dinner is having your pick of the litter at more restaurants that tend to get booked weeks in advance in the seventh hour. \n\nWherever you sit on the pendulum that is the debate over the best time to eat dinner, there’s a growing case that an early-bird meal can help improve your overall health and well-being. \n\nThe health benefits of an early dinner \n\nIt may help prevent heartburn\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/early-dinner-time-improve-health/\n\nSource 1:\nFor more on healthy eating:\n\n * A five-day, fastlike diet could help you live longer.

We can make a nutritious meal consisting of whole foods versus grabbing the easily accessible highly processed options in the pantry or freezer when coming up against the bedtime clock. “When you come home from work hungry, it’s the perfect opportunity to fill up on nutritious, satisfying foods like protein and vegetables,” she says. \n\nHave you ever become the unpleasant, hangry friend who begins to get agitated waiting for the 8 p.m. dinner? Guilty. If you’re hungry right after a long workday but don’t usually eat until later, you may find yourself mindlessly snacking out of hunger and boredom as you wait.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/early-dinner-time-improve-health/\n\nSource 2:\nTo illustrate, I threw out some dates and found a United flight from Atlanta to Chicago for just 10,000 Aeroplan points (plus fees) each way. That gives us 80,000 Miles left over to book a nice hotel through Capital One Travel (there aren’t a lot of high-end Wyndham options in Chi-town), and start making the most important reservations of all: dinner. \n\nIf you haven’t yet seen The Bear on Hulu, it’s an exquisite, hyper-realistic drama about the food industry that also serves as a potent advertisement for the Chicago culinary scene. The on-screen characters frequently visit local Michelin-starred restaurants, sampling deep dish pizza, flaky salmon and jus-soaked kobe beef as we watch from home, fighting the urge to lick our TV. \n\nSo why not make their fantasy your reality? You won’t have to look hard to find a list of all the eateries featured in The Bear, from the world’s first Michelin-starred Filipino restaurant (Kasama)...\n\n…to the humble-yet-legendary Mr. Beef, which helped inspire the show in the first place.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/recommends/credit-cards/dream-trips-100000-capital-one-miles/\n\nSource 3:\nWe recently launched steak, so my bowl today is arugula and saffron basmati rice as my base. And then I get a scoop of hummus and a scoop of crazy feta—always have to get crazy feta. And then I get half steak, half harissa honey chicken—a nice balance there. And then I\'ll do a bunch of toppings, like our fiery broccoli, our roasted corn, pickled onions, a little crumbled feta, some pita crisp for some crunch, and then top it off with either lemon herb tahini or tahini Caesar. But if I want it really spicy, I\'ll go with our hot harissa vinaigrette.\n\nHave you ever worked at a Cava restaurant before?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/06/cava-ceo-brett-schulman-career-interview/\n\nSource 4:\nIn the spring and summer, think vegetable-forward casseroles like carrot casserole <https://urbanfarmie.com/carrot-casserole/>. It\'s bright, and fresh, and pairs perfectly with grilled meats or a light salad. As the weather cools down in fall and winter, we naturally crave heartier dishes. That\'s where classics like a corn casserole or a green bean casserole come in. Rich, creamy and indulgent - this is the kind of dish that makes you want to curl up with a good movie after dinner.\n\nWhat\'s even better is that casseroles allow you to cook with what\'s in season, so they\'re great for home gardeners or anyone trying to eat more seasonally. It\'s the ultimate one-dish meal, no matter the time of year.\n\n\n\nWhy casseroles work for everyone\n\nThere\'s a reason casseroles have stood the test of time - they\'re practical, and they work for just about everyone. Everything gets baked in one dish, so cleanup is a breeze. Less time scrubbing means more time enjoying your meal.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/21/gen-z-casseroles-viral-tiktok-inflations-budget-recipes-millennials/\n\nSource 4:\nAnd she\'s right. For millennials and Gen Z, who are juggling busy lives, casseroles offer the perfect balance of ease and creativity. These recipes are not only simple but also adaptable - meaning you can throw in whatever\'s in the fridge and make it work. It\'s no wonder that casseroles have become a go-to for weeknight dinners, potlucks and meal preps.\n\nTake the viral three-ingredient broccoli cheese casserole <https://urbanfarmie.com/3-ingredient-broccoli-cheese-casserole/>. You can\'t beat a recipe this simple. Just three ingredients, and you\'ve got a creamy, cheesy dish that\'s perfect for busy nights when you don\'t have time to fuss over dinner.\n\n\n\nCasseroles are the ultimate year-round dish\n\nOne of the things that makes casseroles so special is their versatility - they truly work in every season. They\'re not just for cozy winter nights - though there\'s nothing quite like curling up with a warm, bubbling casserole. Depending on the ingredients, casseroles can easily be adapted to lighter, fresher versions that are perfect for warmer weather.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/21/gen-z-casseroles-viral-tiktok-inflations-budget-recipes-millennials/\n\nSource 5:\nThe millennial co-founder making pasta with Chef Mario: \nI do eat lunch \'al desko\' regularly but I order from Deliveroo all the time. I will happily spend up to £20 on lunch and like to eat all sorts of different cuisines from around the world.

We otherwise order food (often an Indian, Japanese or Chinese) or eat out. When eating out I like to try cuisines I have never experienced for. One of my most memorable eating experiences was at a place called Dilara, an Uighur cuisine restaurant in Finsbury Park. I happened to be in the area, saw it on Google Maps, and decided to try it. The food was so spicy, redolent and full of flavour, with hand-pulled noodles and intoxicating Sichuan peppers. It never ceases to amaze me how many exquisite foodstuffs lie in wait to be discovered from across our planet.\n\nThe treats\n\nHow do you unwind from the top job?\n\nI am the first to admit that, after a long and stressful day, I like to unwind with a drink. I could pretend I attend yoga or mindfulness sessions, but the truth is I prefer to relax on my sofa.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/01/pasta-evangelists-millennial-co-founder-the-good-life/\n\nSource 6:\nwalking through an area of small woods alternating with plowed fields and pastures. It didn\'t look like we were about to cross a border. It looked like we were lost. In one of the fields, a small man was plowing using a plow pulled by a single ox. We approached him, trudging through even more mud. When he heard us, he looked at us without the slightest surprise. He straightened up and we saw that he was a hunchback. We asked for directions to the border. He looked around in the dusk, peering at the surrounding woods for any possible eavesdroppers. Then he gestured in a particular direction and in a quiet voice, which seemed unnecessary as nobody was around us in the field, said his house was over there and we should go in and wait for him. We thanked him and set off in the direction he indicated. Soon we found the farmhouse. We knocked. A voice told us to come in. A stunningly beautiful woman was cooking dinner. She was dressed in an elaborate traditional peasant costume that reminded me of folk dancers I\'d seen in shows in Budapest. We told her, "The man outside sent us." She nodded and invited us to sit down for dinner. In short order,\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/book-excerpt-escape-from-budapest/'}

If you’re hungry after a 5:30 dinner before you go to bed, it might be too early for you. Consider testing out a 6:30 or 7 p.m. meal. \n * Avoid late-night snacking. Schmidt warns that eating an early dinner and then snacking late at night offsets the benefits: “We know that when people eat later at night, they have a higher risk of obesity.” \n * Plan ahead for the busy days. “I recognize that my kid has sports every Wednesday, so every Wednesday is going to be Crockpot Wednesday because we have to get in the house, change over, get them dinner, and get out again, as opposed to waiting until after practice,” Schmidt says. \nKeep in mind, experts have said <https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/25/best-time-to-eat-dinner/> that what is on your plate is still more important than when you eat. Half the plate should consist of non-starchy vegetables, a fourth should have lean protein, and another fourth should have a whole grain or starchy vegetable. \n\nFor more on healthy eating:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/early-dinner-time-improve-health/\n\nSource 1:\n“If you assume 5:30 p.m. is ‘too early’ for dinner, you might end up snacking on processed carbs like chips and crackers, which can lead to overeating,” Muhlstein says. \n\nIf you’re still hungry after an early dinner, don’t fret. You may consider adjusting the time you eat. If you need a snack, Schmidt recommends grabbing something high in water content, like easily digestible fruit, or a food high in fiber and protein to sustain fullness, like a whole grain. \n\nYou may lower your disease risk \n\nEating late at night has been associated with a higher overall calorie intake and an increased risk for obesity <https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(22)00397-7#%20>. One study suggests that the hormone responsible for feeling full, leptin A, decreases later in the day, which can lead to overeating when you have a late meal. Particularly for those with diabetes or obesity, eating earlier can also help with insulin sensitivity.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/early-dinner-time-improve-health/\n\nSource 1:\nThere are the night owls <https://fortune.com/well/2023/09/11/night-owls-unhealthy-lifestyle-habits-higher-risk-diabetes/> who refuse to turn the stove on until half past eight and eat out only when the late-night ambience draws in the crowds. Then there are those hangry ones who loathe a late dinner reservation and swear by an early meal well before the sun sets. Like my mom says, who wants to sit hungry for hours just to eat when the cool kids do?\nDinnertimes have been trending earlier. According to Resy <https://blog.resy.com/2022/05/5-p-m-is-the-new-8-p-m-at-new-york-restaurants-and-i-couldnt-be-happier/>, an online reservation platform, more people have been making reservations at 5:30 p.m. in New York City, and fewer people have been making them at 8 p.m. compared to years prior. Last year, the number of dinner reservations made before 5 p.m. doubled compared to 2019, according to Yelp <https://www.marketplace.org/2023/09/22/6-p-m-dinner-reservations-are-losing-their-stigma/>. Not to mention, an unintended benefit of the 5:30 dinner is having your pick of the litter at more restaurants that tend to get booked weeks in advance in the seventh hour. \n\nWherever you sit on the pendulum that is the debate over the best time to eat dinner, there’s a growing case that an early-bird meal can help improve your overall health and well-being. \n\nThe health benefits of an early dinner \n\nIt may help prevent heartburn\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/early-dinner-time-improve-health/\n\nSource 1:\nFor more on healthy eating:\n\n * A five-day, fastlike diet could help you live longer.

We can make a nutritious meal consisting of whole foods versus grabbing the easily accessible highly processed options in the pantry or freezer when coming up against the bedtime clock. “When you come home from work hungry, it’s the perfect opportunity to fill up on nutritious, satisfying foods like protein and vegetables,” she says. \n\nHave you ever become the unpleasant, hangry friend who begins to get agitated waiting for the 8 p.m. dinner? Guilty. If you’re hungry right after a long workday but don’t usually eat until later, you may find yourself mindlessly snacking out of hunger and boredom as you wait.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/well/article/early-dinner-time-improve-health/\n\nSource 2:\nTo illustrate, I threw out some dates and found a United flight from Atlanta to Chicago for just 10,000 Aeroplan points (plus fees) each way. That gives us 80,000 Miles left over to book a nice hotel through Capital One Travel (there aren’t a lot of high-end Wyndham options in Chi-town), and start making the most important reservations of all: dinner. \n\nIf you haven’t yet seen The Bear on Hulu, it’s an exquisite, hyper-realistic drama about the food industry that also serves as a potent advertisement for the Chicago culinary scene. The on-screen characters frequently visit local Michelin-starred restaurants, sampling deep dish pizza, flaky salmon and jus-soaked kobe beef as we watch from home, fighting the urge to lick our TV. \n\nSo why not make their fantasy your reality? You won’t have to look hard to find a list of all the eateries featured in The Bear, from the world’s first Michelin-starred Filipino restaurant (Kasama)...\n\n…to the humble-yet-legendary Mr. Beef, which helped inspire the show in the first place.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/recommends/credit-cards/dream-trips-100000-capital-one-miles/\n\nSource 3:\nWe recently launched steak, so my bowl today is arugula and saffron basmati rice as my base. And then I get a scoop of hummus and a scoop of crazy feta—always have to get crazy feta. And then I get half steak, half harissa honey chicken—a nice balance there. And then I\'ll do a bunch of toppings, like our fiery broccoli, our roasted corn, pickled onions, a little crumbled feta, some pita crisp for some crunch, and then top it off with either lemon herb tahini or tahini Caesar. But if I want it really spicy, I\'ll go with our hot harissa vinaigrette.\n\nHave you ever worked at a Cava restaurant before?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/06/cava-ceo-brett-schulman-career-interview/\n\nSource 4:\nIn the spring and summer, think vegetable-forward casseroles like carrot casserole <https://urbanfarmie.com/carrot-casserole/>. It\'s bright, and fresh, and pairs perfectly with grilled meats or a light salad. As the weather cools down in fall and winter, we naturally crave heartier dishes. That\'s where classics like a corn casserole or a green bean casserole come in. Rich, creamy and indulgent - this is the kind of dish that makes you want to curl up with a good movie after dinner.\n\nWhat\'s even better is that casseroles allow you to cook with what\'s in season, so they\'re great for home gardeners or anyone trying to eat more seasonally. It\'s the ultimate one-dish meal, no matter the time of year.\n\n\n\nWhy casseroles work for everyone\n\nThere\'s a reason casseroles have stood the test of time - they\'re practical, and they work for just about everyone. Everything gets baked in one dish, so cleanup is a breeze. Less time scrubbing means more time enjoying your meal.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/21/gen-z-casseroles-viral-tiktok-inflations-budget-recipes-millennials/\n\nSource 4:\nAnd she\'s right. For millennials and Gen Z, who are juggling busy lives, casseroles offer the perfect balance of ease and creativity. These recipes are not only simple but also adaptable - meaning you can throw in whatever\'s in the fridge and make it work. It\'s no wonder that casseroles have become a go-to for weeknight dinners, potlucks and meal preps.\n\nTake the viral three-ingredient broccoli cheese casserole <https://urbanfarmie.com/3-ingredient-broccoli-cheese-casserole/>. You can\'t beat a recipe this simple. Just three ingredients, and you\'ve got a creamy, cheesy dish that\'s perfect for busy nights when you don\'t have time to fuss over dinner.\n\n\n\nCasseroles are the ultimate year-round dish\n\nOne of the things that makes casseroles so special is their versatility - they truly work in every season. They\'re not just for cozy winter nights - though there\'s nothing quite like curling up with a warm, bubbling casserole. Depending on the ingredients, casseroles can easily be adapted to lighter, fresher versions that are perfect for warmer weather.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/21/gen-z-casseroles-viral-tiktok-inflations-budget-recipes-millennials/\n\nSource 5:\nThe millennial co-founder making pasta with Chef Mario: \nI do eat lunch \'al desko\' regularly but I order from Deliveroo all the time. I will happily spend up to £20 on lunch and like to eat all sorts of different cuisines from around the world. My idea of suffering would be to eat the same dish, day in, day out.\n\nIf I am dining in a business context, I like to eat something simple and easy to eat to avoid any faux pas moments—Flat Iron is a good choice for a flavoursome steak and side salad.\n\nWhere do you buy groceries?\n\nUsually from M&S, as this is closest to my home.\n\nHow often in a week do you dine out versus cook at home?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/01/pasta-evangelists-millennial-co-founder-the-good-life/\n\nSource 5:\nHow often in a week do you dine out versus cook at home?\n\nI cook for myself and my partner about 3 to 4 times a week. We otherwise order food (often an Indian, Japanese or Chinese) or eat out. When eating out I like to try cuisines I have never experienced for. One of my most memorable eating experiences was at a place called Dilara, an Uighur cuisine restaurant in Finsbury Park. I happened to be in the area, saw it on Google Maps, and decided to try it. The food was so spicy, redolent and full of flavour, with hand-pulled noodles and intoxicating Sichuan peppers. It never ceases to amaze me how many exquisite foodstuffs lie in wait to be discovered from across our planet.\n\nThe treats\n\nHow do you unwind from the top job?\n\nI am the first to admit that, after a long and stressful day, I like to unwind with a drink. I could pretend I attend yoga or mindfulness sessions, but the truth is I prefer to relax on my sofa.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/01/pasta-evangelists-millennial-co-founder-the-good-life/\n\nSource 6:\nwalking through an area of small woods alternating with plowed fields and pastures.

We asked for directions to the border. He looked around in the dusk, peering at the surrounding woods for any possible eavesdroppers. Then he gestured in a particular direction and in a quiet voice, which seemed unnecessary as nobody was around us in the field, said his house was over there and we should go in and wait for him. We thanked him and set off in the direction he indicated. Soon we found the farmhouse. We knocked. A voice told us to come in. A stunningly beautiful woman was cooking dinner.

2024-11-08 06:46:48,488: ObserveEventsHandler(  207): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd response: assistant: Deciding what to make for dinner can be a challenging task, but I'm here to help. Considering the importance of healthy eating, I would recommend making a nutritious meal consisting of whole foods, such as protein and vegetables [1]. A vegetable-forward casserole, like a carrot casserole, would be a great option, especially during the spring and summer seasons [4]. You can also consider making a dish with lean protein, such as steak or chicken, paired with a whole grain or starchy vegetable [1].

If you're looking for something simple and adaptable, a casserole recipe would be an excellent choice. Casseroles offer the perfect balance of ease and creativity, making them ideal for busy weeknight dinners [4]. You can throw in whatever ingredients you have in the fridge and make it work. For example, a three-ingredient broccoli cheese casserole is a simple and delicious option that's perfect for busy nights [4]. Additionally, casseroles are versatile and can be adapted to lighter, fresher versions that are perfect for warmer weather [4].

If you're in the mood for something more indulgent, you could consider making a hearty dish like a corn casserole or a green bean casserole [4]. These classic dishes are rich, creamy, and indulgent, making them perfect for a cozy night in. Whatever you choose to make, be sure to prioritize healthy ingredients and portion control to ensure a balanced meal [1].
