Real GDP growth was solid in the second quarter, and looks even better with an upward revision," Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Bank, said in a note.\n\nA GDP category that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a healthy 2.9% annual rate, up from 2.6% in the first quarter.

Neither trend revealed much about the economy’s underlying health.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/u-s-economy-gdp-growth-2024-q2/>', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.63789004), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='e3ba49da-3a38-4cf3-911c-14b30c8164a0', embedding=None, metadata={'id': 'ae44bc8c8b3dcb1ea6f52956b2614d967aa63dea8e2b8d62a70a266ef87205c4-0', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': 'ae44bc8c8b3dcb1ea6f52956b2614d967aa63dea8e2b8d62a70a266ef87205c4', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20240725, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-08', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2162667315-e1721923233703.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2024, 'date_month': 7, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/u-s-economy-gdp-growth-2024-q2/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 25, 'title': 'U.S. economy sped up last quarter, boosting hopes for a ‘soft landing’', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/u-s-economy-gdp-growth-2024-q2/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The nation’s economy accelerated last quarter at a strong 2.8% annual pace, with consumers and businesses helping drive growth despite the pressure of continually high interest rates.\n\nThursday’s report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product — the economy’s total output of goods and services — picked up in the April-June quarter after growing at a 1.4% pace in the January-March period.

In its latest update the CBO wrote, “In CBO’s current projections, the deficit for 2024 is $400 billion (or 27%) larger than it was in the agency’s February 2024 projections, and the cumulative deficit over the 2025–2034 period is larger by $2.1 trillion (10%)."\n\nIt reported debt held by the public will rise from 99% of GDP this year to 122% by 2034—surpassing its previous high of 106% in 1946, at the end of the Second World War.\n\nCuts vs. growth\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/16/larry-fink-national-debt-burden-future-generations/\n\nSource 2:\nThe central bank has recently become more concerned about supporting the job market, which has been gradually weakening, than about continuing to fight inflation. The unemployment rate has risen for four straight months, to 4.3%, still low by historical standards. Job openings and the pace of hiring have also dropped, though they remain at relatively solid levels.\n\nThursday’s report was the Commerce Department’s second estimate of GDP growth in the April-June quarter. It will issue its final estimate late next month.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/08/29/economy-gdp-growth-profit/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/29/economy-gdp-growth-profit/\n\nSource 2:\nBut measures of consumers\' spirits by the Conference Board and the University of Michigan have shown a recent uptick in confidence in the economy.\n\n“The GDP revisions show the U.S. economy was in good shape in mid-2024,’’ said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica <https://fortune.com/company/comerica/> Bank. “Solid growth of consumer spending propelled the economy forward in the second quarter, and the increase of consumer confidence in July suggests it will propel growth in the second half of the year as well."\n\nCorporate profits also rose, reaching an annualized $3.425 trillion in the third quarter—a new record.\n\nThe latest GDP estimate for the April-June quarter included figures that showed that inflation continues to ease while remaining just above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The central bank’s favored inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at a 2.5% annual rate last quarter, down from 3.4% in the first quarter of the year. And excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation grew at a 2.7% pace, down from 3.2% from January through March.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/29/economy-gdp-growth-profit/\n\nSource 2:\nBoth the PCE inflation numbers issued Thursday marked a slight improvement on the government\'s first estimate.\n\n"The U.S. economic expansion continues even as inflation slows. Real GDP growth was solid in the second quarter, and looks even better with an upward revision," Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Bank, said in a note.\n\nA GDP category that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a healthy 2.9% annual rate, up from 2.6% in the first quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items such as exports, inventories and government spending.\n\nTo fight spiking prices, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023, lifting it to a 23-year high and helping shrink annual inflation from a peak of 9.1% to 2.9% as of last month. The much higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses that resulted had been widely expected to cause a recession. Yet the economy has kept growing and employers have kept hiring.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/29/economy-gdp-growth-profit/\n\nSource 3:\nBut American tourism abroad is treated like an imported service when calculating GDP, which saw disappointing growth in the first quarter <https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/economy-gdp-growth-high-interest-rates-1-6/> due in part to a wider trade deficit. In recent months, the share of service imports allocated to travel hit the highest level since 2005, when the dollar also experienced a period of strength, according to a note from Wells Fargo <https://fortune.com/company/wells-fargo/> on Friday.\n\n"On the services side of trade, the United States runs a trade surplus, so if foreign travel continues to ramp up alongside a swelling goods deficit, net exports could meaningfully weigh on real GDP growth," analysts wrote. \n\nWells Fargo also calculated that a similar period of dollar strength from 2014 to 2015 saw travel imports (Americans vacationing abroad) grow by about $1.1 billion, while travel exports (foreigners vacationing in the U.S.) were little changed.\n\nTo be sure, $1.1 billion worth of travel services represents a 1.5% share of the total trade balance, analysts added. But don\'t let that small share fool you.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/12/dollar-dominance-americans-cheaper-vacations-overseas-us-economic-outlook-trade-deficit/\n\nSource 4:\n“The Fed will be reassured’’ by Thursday\'s GDP report, said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica <https://fortune.com/company/comerica/> Bank. “With inflation trending lower ... the Fed thinks that it’s getting close to the time to cut interest rates.’’\n\nRate reductions by the Fed would, over time, reduce consumers’ borrowing costs for things like mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.\n\nThe state of the economy has seized Americans’ attention as the presidential campaign has intensified. Though inflation has slowed sharply, to 3% <https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-interest-rates-economy-federal-reserve-53d93610b5ccaacd097853593f29bc26> from 9.1% in 2022, prices remain well above their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThis year’s economic slowdown reflects, in large part, the much higher borrowing rates for home and auto loans, credit cards and many business loans resulting from the Fed’s aggressive series of interest rate hikes.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/u-s-economy-gdp-growth-2024-q2/\n\nSource 4:\nThe Fed’s rate hikes — 11 of them in 2022 and 2023 — were a response to the flare-up in inflation that began in the spring of 2021 as the economy rebounded with unexpected speed from the COVID-19 recession, causing severe supply shortages. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 made things worse by inflating prices for the energy and grains the world depends on. Prices spiked across the country and the world.\n\nEconomists had long predicted that the higher borrowing costs would tip the United States into recession. Yet the economy kept chugging along. Consumers, whose spending accounts for roughly 70% of GDP, kept buying things, emboldened by a strong job market and savings they had built up during the COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\nThe slowdown at the start of this year was caused largely by two factors, each of which can vary sharply from quarter to quarter: A surge in imports and a drop in business inventories. Neither trend revealed much about the economy’s underlying health.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/u-s-economy-gdp-growth-2024-q2/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/u-s-economy-gdp-growth-2024-q2/\n\nSource 4:\nThe nation’s economy accelerated last quarter at a strong 2.8% annual pace, with consumers and businesses helping drive growth despite the pressure of continually high interest rates.\n\nThursday’s report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product — the economy’s total output of goods and services — picked up in the April-June quarter after growing at a 1.4% pace in the January-March period. Economists had expected a weaker 1.9% annual pace of growth.\n\nThe GDP report also showed that inflation continues to ease, while still remaining above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The central bank’s favored inflation gauge rose at a 2.6% annual rate last quarter, down from 3.4% in the first quarter of the year. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation increased at a 2.9% pace. That was down from 3.7% from January through March.\n\nThe latest figures should reinforce confidence that the U.S. economy is on the verge of achieving a rare “soft landing,” whereby high interest rates, engineered by the Fed, tame inflation without tipping the economy into a recession.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/u-s-economy-gdp-growth-2024-q2/\n\nSource 5:\nReaching net-zero emissions is essential to mitigating the worst effects of climate change, but it will also take a massive investment, according to Goldman Sachs <https://fortune.com/company/goldman-sachs-group/> Research. \n\nOffsetting the greenhouse gases produced by human activities by 2070 will require an investment of about $75 trillion, Goldman wrote <https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/reaching-net-zero-is-forecast-to-require-nearly-75-trillion-of-investment>. \n\nTo put that amount into perspective, it’s more than two and a half times the U.S. GDP, which hit $29.35 trillion <https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/gross-domestic-product-third-quarter-2024-advance-estimate> in the third quarter.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/11/01/net-zero-costs-75-trillion-carbon-emissions-greenhouse-gases-paris-agreement/\n\nSource 6:\nThe fact that these two metrics coincided <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-18/stagflation-trade-is-roaring-back-in-s-p-500-s-month-of-pain> made the latest data “the worst of both worlds <https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/high-inflation-low-economic-grow-worst-of-both-worlds-gdp-report/>.” The Fed wants inflation to come down to its 2% goal, which hasn’t happened yet. More worrying, though, is inflation’s stubbornness and the difficulty in getting through the so-called last mile toward that mark. At the same time, inventors want to see strong GDP growth to bolster a stock market rally.

Neither trend revealed much about the economy’s underlying health.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/u-s-economy-gdp-growth-2024-q2/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/u-s-economy-gdp-growth-2024-q2/\n\nSource 4:\nThe nation’s economy accelerated last quarter at a strong 2.8% annual pace, with consumers and businesses helping drive growth despite the pressure of continually high interest rates.\n\nThursday’s report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product — the economy’s total output of goods and services — picked up in the April-June quarter after growing at a 1.4% pace in the January-March period. Economists had expected a weaker 1.9% annual pace of growth.\n\nThe GDP report also showed that inflation continues to ease, while still remaining above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The central bank’s favored inflation gauge rose at a 2.6% annual rate last quarter, down from 3.4% in the first quarter of the year. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation increased at a 2.9% pace. That was down from 3.7% from January through March.\n\nThe latest figures should reinforce confidence that the U.S. economy is on the verge of achieving a rare “soft landing,” whereby high interest rates, engineered by the Fed, tame inflation without tipping the economy into a recession.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/u-s-economy-gdp-growth-2024-q2/\n\nSource 5:\nReaching net-zero emissions is essential to mitigating the worst effects of climate change, but it will also take a massive investment, according to Goldman Sachs <https://fortune.com/company/goldman-sachs-group/> Research. \n\nOffsetting the greenhouse gases produced by human activities by 2070 will require an investment of about $75 trillion, Goldman wrote <https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/reaching-net-zero-is-forecast-to-require-nearly-75-trillion-of-investment>. \n\nTo put that amount into perspective, it’s more than two and a half times the U.S. GDP, which hit $29.35 trillion <https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/gross-domestic-product-third-quarter-2024-advance-estimate> in the third quarter.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/11/01/net-zero-costs-75-trillion-carbon-emissions-greenhouse-gases-paris-agreement/\n\nSource 6:\nThe fact that these two metrics coincided <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-18/stagflation-trade-is-roaring-back-in-s-p-500-s-month-of-pain> made the latest data “the worst of both worlds <https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/high-inflation-low-economic-grow-worst-of-both-worlds-gdp-report/>.” The Fed wants inflation to come down to its 2% goal, which hasn’t happened yet. More worrying, though, is inflation’s stubbornness and the difficulty in getting through the so-called last mile toward that mark. At the same time, inventors want to see strong GDP growth to bolster a stock market rally. At the moment it seems as if neither of those is happening. \n\nStagflation still isn’t upon the U.S. economy just yet because the unemployment rate isn’t high at the moment, which is the third requirement. Currently unemployment remains below 4%, indicating a healthy job market.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/26/inflation-stagflation-ubs-economy-federal-reserve-jerome-powell-unemployment-recession/\n\nSource 7:\nEven former Chinese premier Li Keqiang, according to <https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6B527D/> U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks in 2010, called China’s GDP figures “man-made.” Li reportedly relied on his own measure of economic activity: The “Li Keqiang Index,” as dubbed by The Economist <https://www.economist.com/asia/2010/12/09/keqiang-ker-ching>, which combined railway freight traffic, electricity consumption, and total bank loans.

The unemployment rate has risen for four straight months, to 4.3%, still low by historical standards. Job openings and the pace of hiring have also dropped, though they remain at relatively solid levels.\n\nThursday’s report was the Commerce Department’s second estimate of GDP growth in the April-June quarter. It will issue its final estimate late next month.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/08/29/economy-gdp-growth-profit/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/29/economy-gdp-growth-profit/\n\nSource 2:\nBut measures of consumers\' spirits by the Conference Board and the University of Michigan have shown a recent uptick in confidence in the economy.\n\n“The GDP revisions show the U.S. economy was in good shape in mid-2024,’’ said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica <https://fortune.com/company/comerica/> Bank. “Solid growth of consumer spending propelled the economy forward in the second quarter, and the increase of consumer confidence in July suggests it will propel growth in the second half of the year as well."\n\nCorporate profits also rose, reaching an annualized $3.425 trillion in the third quarter—a new record.\n\nThe latest GDP estimate for the April-June quarter included figures that showed that inflation continues to ease while remaining just above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The central bank’s favored inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at a 2.5% annual rate last quarter, down from 3.4% in the first quarter of the year. And excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation grew at a 2.7% pace, down from 3.2% from January through March.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/29/economy-gdp-growth-profit/\n\nSource 2:\nBoth the PCE inflation numbers issued Thursday marked a slight improvement on the government\'s first estimate.\n\n"The U.S. economic expansion continues even as inflation slows.

This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items such as exports, inventories and government spending.\n\nTo fight spiking prices, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023, lifting it to a 23-year high and helping shrink annual inflation from a peak of 9.1% to 2.9% as of last month. The much higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses that resulted had been widely expected to cause a recession.

In recent months, the share of service imports allocated to travel hit the highest level since 2005, when the dollar also experienced a period of strength, according to a note from Wells Fargo <https://fortune.com/company/wells-fargo/> on Friday.\n\n"On the services side of trade, the United States runs a trade surplus, so if foreign travel continues to ramp up alongside a swelling goods deficit, net exports could meaningfully weigh on real GDP growth," analysts wrote. \n\nWells Fargo also calculated that a similar period of dollar strength from 2014 to 2015 saw travel imports (Americans vacationing abroad) grow by about $1.1 billion, while travel exports (foreigners vacationing in the U.S.) were little changed.\n\nTo be sure, $1.1 billion worth of travel services represents a 1.5% share of the total trade balance, analysts added.

Though inflation has slowed sharply, to 3% <https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-interest-rates-economy-federal-reserve-53d93610b5ccaacd097853593f29bc26> from 9.1% in 2022, prices remain well above their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThis year’s economic slowdown reflects, in large part, the much higher borrowing rates for home and auto loans, credit cards and many business loans resulting from the Fed’s aggressive series of interest rate hikes.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/u-s-economy-gdp-growth-2024-q2/\n\nSource 4:\nThe Fed’s rate hikes — 11 of them in 2022 and 2023 — were a response to the flare-up in inflation that began in the spring of 2021 as the economy rebounded with unexpected speed from the COVID-19 recession, causing severe supply shortages.
