There were some meaningful achievements, like an agreement to facilitate foreign direct investment into developing countries. But ministers largely agreed to keep talking, ahead of future meetings. Unfortunately, there was no discussion of AI or how to use data, two of today’s hottest topics.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/08/24/wto-can-solve-global-trade-problems-by-doing-less/\n\nSource 3:\nFortune has long promoted the importance of having a global mindset and understanding of issues impacting all businesses, not just your own.

The topic came up quite a bit on the stage for companies subject to that sort of thing, including finance firms and health organizations. Behind the scenes, though, there were fewer complaints about the regulation itself and more about how it slowed down innovation and clouded visibility.

Rare indeed were conversations about the recent attempted assassination of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, a topic perhaps too complex for even AI to fully digest. The exception? The naming of Donald Trump\'s running mate, J.D. Vance. While investor Ben Harburg and policy advisor Jacob Helberg debated the finer points <https://fortune.com/asia/2024/07/16/us-china-conflict-war-export-controls-brainstorm-tech/> of U.S.-China policy onstage, attendees offstage discussed onetime venture capitalist Vance, whose time in San Francisco endeared him to some libertarian techies—principally those who weren\'t women or LGBTQIA+.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/18/ai-fud-fear-uncertainty-doubt-ceos/\n\nSource 5:\nEmployees, especially younger workers, are calling for corporate leaders <https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/09/employees-want-to-talk-about-politics-at-work-but-it-comes-with-risks.html> to talk more about the cultural issues of the day.

The World Bank expects emerging market and developing countries to collectively grow 4% this year, down from 4.2% in 2023. In many cases, their populations are outpacing their economies, reducing their annual income growth per person to 3% this year through 2026 — far below the average 3.8% in the decade before the pandemic struck.\n\nChina, the world’s second-largest economy after the United States, is struggling with the collapse of its real estate market and with weak consumer confidence. The Chinese economy is expected to decelerate to 4.8% this year from 5.2% in 2023.\n\nGrowth in Latin America is forecast to slow from 2.2% last year to 1.8% in 2024. The World Bank expects the economy of sub-Saharan Africa to grow 3.5%, modest but up from 3% last year.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/11/interest-rates-world-bank-global-growth-us-economy-ayhan-kose/\n\nSource 9:\nAsk CEOs what keeps them up at night <https://fortune.com/2024/05/20/satya-nadella-microsoft-build-generative-ai-openai/>, and you’ll likely get a brief answer from a familiar drop-down menu of angst—climate change, inflation, cyberattacks. But some of the most challenging global problems are tricky precisely because they’re closely connected to other problems. \n\nThat’s why the World Economic Forum gets granular in its risk survey, asking business and government leaders about a more detailed range of threats—and analyzing how those threats influence one another. Notice the lines in this risk map that connect, say, inflation to unemployment, or extreme weather to supply-chain disruptions. Leaders who understand how these crises are interrelated, the thinking goes, are better prepared to survive any and all of them.\n\nA version of this article appears in the June/July 2024 issue <https://fortune.com/packages/june-july-2024/> of Fortune with the headline, "Clusters of worry for world leaders."\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/global-business-leaders-worries-risk-climate-change-inflation-cyberattacks-interconnected-problems/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/global-business-leaders-worries-risk-climate-change-inflation-cyberattacks-interconnected-problems/\n\nSource 10:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/wef-chair-klaus-schwab-edison-1b-people-internet-world-ai-tech/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/wef-chair-klaus-schwab-edison-1b-people-internet-world-ai-tech/\n\nSource 11:\nUpcoming event: Join at the Fortune Global Forum, convening Nov. 11 and 12 in New York City.

The World Bank expects emerging market and developing countries to collectively grow 4% this year, down from 4.2% in 2023. In many cases, their populations are outpacing their economies, reducing their annual income growth per person to 3% this year through 2026 — far below the average 3.8% in the decade before the pandemic struck.\n\nChina, the world’s second-largest economy after the United States, is struggling with the collapse of its real estate market and with weak consumer confidence. The Chinese economy is expected to decelerate to 4.8% this year from 5.2% in 2023.\n\nGrowth in Latin America is forecast to slow from 2.2% last year to 1.8% in 2024. The World Bank expects the economy of sub-Saharan Africa to grow 3.5%, modest but up from 3% last year.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/11/interest-rates-world-bank-global-growth-us-economy-ayhan-kose/\n\nSource 9:\nAsk CEOs what keeps them up at night <https://fortune.com/2024/05/20/satya-nadella-microsoft-build-generative-ai-openai/>, and you’ll likely get a brief answer from a familiar drop-down menu of angst—climate change, inflation, cyberattacks. But some of the most challenging global problems are tricky precisely because they’re closely connected to other problems. \n\nThat’s why the World Economic Forum gets granular in its risk survey, asking business and government leaders about a more detailed range of threats—and analyzing how those threats influence one another. Notice the lines in this risk map that connect, say, inflation to unemployment, or extreme weather to supply-chain disruptions. Leaders who understand how these crises are interrelated, the thinking goes, are better prepared to survive any and all of them.\n\nA version of this article appears in the June/July 2024 issue <https://fortune.com/packages/june-july-2024/> of Fortune with the headline, "Clusters of worry for world leaders."\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/global-business-leaders-worries-risk-climate-change-inflation-cyberattacks-interconnected-problems/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/global-business-leaders-worries-risk-climate-change-inflation-cyberattacks-interconnected-problems/\n\nSource 10:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/wef-chair-klaus-schwab-edison-1b-people-internet-world-ai-tech/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/wef-chair-klaus-schwab-edison-1b-people-internet-world-ai-tech/\n\nSource 11:\nUpcoming event: Join at the Fortune Global Forum, convening Nov. 11 and 12 in New York City.

2024-11-08 06:47:05,622: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: Unfortunately, I don't have information about the major theme of the 2023 World Economic Forum from the provided sources. The sources mention the World Economic Forum in the context of Niall Ferguson's statement about deglobalization being a "mirage" [6] and the World Economic Forum's risk survey [9], but they do not provide information about the major theme of the 2023 World Economic Forum.

However, I can tell you that the World Economic Forum is an annual meeting that brings together leaders from around the world to discuss pressing global issues. The forum typically focuses on a range of topics, including economic growth, climate change, and technological innovation [9]. But without more specific information, I cannot determine the major theme of the 2023 World Economic Forum.

If you have any more information or context about the 2023 World Economic Forum, I may be able to help you better.
