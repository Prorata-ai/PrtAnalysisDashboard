Much of the fascination focused on the relationships between the close cadre of friends in their late twenties and early thirties who ran the crypto empire, including Bankman-Fried and Ellison, many of whom dated each other. By the time of the trial, all had turned on Bankman-Fried, whose response included leaking Ellison’s private diary to the New York Times.\nAs the CEO of Alameda Research, Ellison played a critical role in FTX and admitted to prosecutors that she was aware—and facilitated—Bankman-Fried’s ploy to funnel billions of dollars of customer funds to his own investments, including in startups <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/09/sam-bankman-fried-trial-500-million-anthropic-investment-ai-claude/>, political donations <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/16/ftx-straw-donor-sam-bankman-fried-nishad-singh/>, and luxury real estate <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/01/17/ftx-just-released-new-details-lavish-spending-253-million-luxury-bahamian-real-estate/>. Still, in her sentencing memo, her lawyers argue that much of her bad judgment stemmed from her long-term relationship with Bankman-Fried, which began while they were both working at the trading firm Jane Street.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/09/11/sam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-adderall-ftx-sentencing/\n\nSource 2:\nBankman-Fried, 32, was convicted last November of fraud and conspiracy a year after his companies collapsed <https://apnews.com/article/ftx-bankruptcy-binance-timeline-c519d50b9059aa8bff0ce8b6cd26c40e> into bankruptcy as investors rushed to withdraw funds. A jury concluded that some of their money had been improperly spent on real estate, investments, celebrity endorsements, political contributions and lavish lifestyles.\n\nAt its height, FTX was treated as a pioneer and darling in the emerging cryptocurrency industry, with a Super Bowl advertisement, testimony by Bankman-Fried before Congress and endorsements from celebrities such as quarterback Tom Brady and comedian Larry David.\n\nBankman-Fried was arrested in December 2022 following his extradition from the Bahamas, just weeks after his company filed for bankruptcy and days after some of his former top executives began cooperating with federal prosecutors. Some of them testified against him at trial.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/13/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-retrial/\n\nSource 2:\nHe initially remained under strict bail conditions at his parents\' home in Palo Alto, California, but Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in Manhattan revoked his bail shortly before the trial after concluding that Bankman-Fried was trying to influence likely witnesses, including an ex-girlfriend who had served as chief executive at Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund.\n\nThe fallen mogul is serving a 25-year sentence <https://apnews.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency-sentencing-sbf-d7bb1a5e94b4c22039d74dfeab1a2ff1> after he was sentenced in March in what a prosecutor once described as one of the biggest financial frauds in U.S. history.\n\nA prosecutor’s spokesperson declined to comment Friday.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/09/13/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-retrial/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/13/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-retrial/\n\nSource 3:\nFor his take on FTX, he conducted a series of previously unreleased interviews with its founder over Zoom <https://fortune.com/company/zoom/>, in the Bahamas where Bankman-Fried lived and FTX was headquartered, during a dinner in Manhattan at the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park, and at his parents’ home in Stanford, Calif., as he prepared for his ill-fated trial. Silver details Bankman-Fried’s risk tolerance and state of mind during those fateful days while also finding him to be reckless and seemingly unaware of the gravity of his actions. \n\n“It\'s the combination of being actually not all that great at risk assessment to be euphemistic—I mean terrible at risk assessment—and being willing to gamble it all that was very destructive and having this bizarre cult of personality around him,” Silver told Fortune. \n\nThroughout the book, he shares numerous examples of Bankman-Fried’s unique combination of bluster, delusion, and radical commitment to trying to measure the odds of everything around him that ultimately doomed him. \n\n“The irony is that Sam is actually not a very good calculator of odds,” Silver said in an interview.\n\nWilling to risk everything\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/nate-silver-sam-bankman-fried-sam-altman-openai-ftx-ai/\n\nSource 3:\nA representative for Bankman-Fried declined to comment. \n\nBankman-Fried wasn’t able to recognize any possibility that Bitcoin might go down, according to Silver. He “literally [said] ‘hey, if you aren\'t willing to risk ruining your life then, you\'re a wimp, and you\'re doing it wrong,’” Silver added, recalling an interview before the events that would lead to his arrest. \n\nIn another interview in the Bahamas <https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/11/22/sbf-ftx-bahamas-house-lifestyle/> in December 2022, after Bankman-Fried had already stepped down as FTX’s CEO and handed the company over to bankruptcy <https://apnews.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud-timeline-be13e3fc0e074e2edd50ba59d1f8960e> lawyers, he maintained access to the exchange’s live trading records. “This cannot get out right now,” Bankman-Fried told Silver.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/nate-silver-sam-bankman-fried-sam-altman-openai-ftx-ai/\n\nSource 4:\nBankman-Fried was her \'Kryptonite\'\n\nEllison\'s downfall has become the subject of morbid fascination over the past two years, as the public has picked over the collapse of FTX, once valued at $32 billion, and its inner circle of 20 and 30-something executives, many of whom dated or counted each other as lifelong friends. \n\nEllison joined Bankman-Fried\'s orbit as a trader at his hedge fund Alameda Research at just 24 years old, and soon becoming its CEO. As she acknowledged during three days of emotional testimony during Bankman-Fried\'s trial last fall, she also played a crucial role in the fraud that took down the empire, with FTX funneling billions in dollars of customer assets to fund disastrous trades at Alameda, along with luxury real estate, illegal campaign donations, and venture investments.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ellison admitted once again that she should have stopped the fraud sooner, but she was unable to, drawn in by what she describes as her admiration—and often unrequited love—of Bankman-Fried. "I\'m sorry I wasn\'t brave," she said.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/09/24/caroline-ellison-ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-sentencing/\n\nSource 5:\nBankman-Fried, Salame, and other accomplices, such as Caroline Ellison, betrayed their trust when they conspired to plug holes in their risky speculation with funds FTX was supposed to hold as a custodian. \n\nWorse, Bankman-Fried repeatedly attempted <https://fortune.com/2022/11/16/ftx-bankruptcy-alameda-research-sbf-sam-bankman-fried-customer-deposits-scandal-lehman-bernie-madoff/.> to deflect criticism and portray his fraud in a more flattering light. \n\nSalame’s boss was eventually sentenced <https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/03/28/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crypto-sentencing-conviction-kaplan/> to 25 years behind bars. \n\nNot everyone cared for Salame’s tongue-in-cheek humor, however. \n\nWisconsin-based public relations professional Jeremy Tunis <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeremytunis_a-pr-case-study-from-ryan-salame-in-how-to-activity-7250265289227968512-EWqY> called the post a case study in “how to generate zero sympathy.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/11/ftx-linkedin-ryan-salame-prison/\n\nSource 5:\nLinkedIn users danced on Salame’s figurative grave because FTX had become one of the most hated companies in America. \n\nIt marked the biggest corporate fraud since Elizabeth Holmes founded fake blood diagnostics firm Theranos.\n\nRun by self-described altruist Sam Bankman-Fried—who once played host to Bill Clinton and Tony Blair—FTX ended up the villain after stealing client funds to cover gambling bets by its sibling crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research.\n\nFTX collapse marked the peak of Crypto Winter\n\nThe November 2022 collapse of FTX marked the peak of a long Crypto Winter <https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/11/07/crypto-billionaires-cz-binance-bankman-fried-ftx-exchange-ftt-busd/>, during which various scandals brought disrepute to an entire industry that served a new breed of digitally savvy consumers. \n\nIn 2020 and 2021, millions around the world sought freedom and security from the constant whir of the central bank printing press by unbanking themselves.\n\nFor these people, cryptocurrencies were a refuge from the traditional financial system and paper money backed only by government fiat.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/11/ftx-linkedin-ryan-salame-prison/\n\nSource 6:\nIn a rare outcome for bankruptcy, customers of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX <https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/04/29/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-endorsements-lawsuit-tom-brady-gisele-shaq-larry-david/> will recover all of their money—and then some.

Much of the fascination focused on the relationships between the close cadre of friends in their late twenties and early thirties who ran the crypto empire, including Bankman-Fried and Ellison, many of whom dated each other. By the time of the trial, all had turned on Bankman-Fried, whose response included leaking Ellison’s private diary to the New York Times.\nAs the CEO of Alameda Research, Ellison played a critical role in FTX and admitted to prosecutors that she was aware—and facilitated—Bankman-Fried’s ploy to funnel billions of dollars of customer funds to his own investments, including in startups <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/09/sam-bankman-fried-trial-500-million-anthropic-investment-ai-claude/>, political donations <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/16/ftx-straw-donor-sam-bankman-fried-nishad-singh/>, and luxury real estate <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/01/17/ftx-just-released-new-details-lavish-spending-253-million-luxury-bahamian-real-estate/>.

A jury concluded that some of their money had been improperly spent on real estate, investments, celebrity endorsements, political contributions and lavish lifestyles.\n\nAt its height, FTX was treated as a pioneer and darling in the emerging cryptocurrency industry, with a Super Bowl advertisement, testimony by Bankman-Fried before Congress and endorsements from celebrities such as quarterback Tom Brady and comedian Larry David.\n\nBankman-Fried was arrested in December 2022 following his extradition from the Bahamas, just weeks after his company filed for bankruptcy and days after some of his former top executives began cooperating with federal prosecutors.

Silver details Bankman-Fried’s risk tolerance and state of mind during those fateful days while also finding him to be reckless and seemingly unaware of the gravity of his actions. \n\n“It\'s the combination of being actually not all that great at risk assessment to be euphemistic—I mean terrible at risk assessment—and being willing to gamble it all that was very destructive and having this bizarre cult of personality around him,” Silver told Fortune. \n\nThroughout the book, he shares numerous examples of Bankman-Fried’s unique combination of bluster, delusion, and radical commitment to trying to measure the odds of everything around him that ultimately doomed him. \n\n“The irony is that Sam is actually not a very good calculator of odds,” Silver said in an interview.\n\nWilling to risk everything\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/nate-silver-sam-bankman-fried-sam-altman-openai-ftx-ai/\n\nSource 3:\nA representative for Bankman-Fried declined to comment. \n\nBankman-Fried wasn’t able to recognize any possibility that Bitcoin might go down, according to Silver.

Much of the fascination focused on the relationships between the close cadre of friends in their late twenties and early thirties who ran the crypto empire, including Bankman-Fried and Ellison, many of whom dated each other. By the time of the trial, all had turned on Bankman-Fried, whose response included leaking Ellison’s private diary to the New York Times.\nAs the CEO of Alameda Research, Ellison played a critical role in FTX and admitted to prosecutors that she was aware—and facilitated—Bankman-Fried’s ploy to funnel billions of dollars of customer funds to his own investments, including in startups <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/09/sam-bankman-fried-trial-500-million-anthropic-investment-ai-claude/>, political donations <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/16/ftx-straw-donor-sam-bankman-fried-nishad-singh/>, and luxury real estate <https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/01/17/ftx-just-released-new-details-lavish-spending-253-million-luxury-bahamian-real-estate/>. Still, in her sentencing memo, her lawyers argue that much of her bad judgment stemmed from her long-term relationship with Bankman-Fried, which began while they were both working at the trading firm Jane Street.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/09/11/sam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-adderall-ftx-sentencing/\n\nSource 2:\nBankman-Fried, 32, was convicted last November of fraud and conspiracy a year after his companies collapsed <https://apnews.com/article/ftx-bankruptcy-binance-timeline-c519d50b9059aa8bff0ce8b6cd26c40e> into bankruptcy as investors rushed to withdraw funds. A jury concluded that some of their money had been improperly spent on real estate, investments, celebrity endorsements, political contributions and lavish lifestyles.\n\nAt its height, FTX was treated as a pioneer and darling in the emerging cryptocurrency industry, with a Super Bowl advertisement, testimony by Bankman-Fried before Congress and endorsements from celebrities such as quarterback Tom Brady and comedian Larry David.\n\nBankman-Fried was arrested in December 2022 following his extradition from the Bahamas, just weeks after his company filed for bankruptcy and days after some of his former top executives began cooperating with federal prosecutors.

Silver details Bankman-Fried’s risk tolerance and state of mind during those fateful days while also finding him to be reckless and seemingly unaware of the gravity of his actions. \n\n“It\'s the combination of being actually not all that great at risk assessment to be euphemistic—I mean terrible at risk assessment—and being willing to gamble it all that was very destructive and having this bizarre cult of personality around him,” Silver told Fortune. \n\nThroughout the book, he shares numerous examples of Bankman-Fried’s unique combination of bluster, delusion, and radical commitment to trying to measure the odds of everything around him that ultimately doomed him. \n\n“The irony is that Sam is actually not a very good calculator of odds,” Silver said in an interview.\n\nWilling to risk everything\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/nate-silver-sam-bankman-fried-sam-altman-openai-ftx-ai/\n\nSource 3:\nA representative for Bankman-Fried declined to comment. \n\nBankman-Fried wasn’t able to recognize any possibility that Bitcoin might go down, according to Silver. He “literally [said] ‘hey, if you aren\'t willing to risk ruining your life then, you\'re a wimp, and you\'re doing it wrong,’” Silver added, recalling an interview before the events that would lead to his arrest. \n\nIn another interview in the Bahamas <https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/11/22/sbf-ftx-bahamas-house-lifestyle/> in December 2022, after Bankman-Fried had already stepped down as FTX’s CEO and handed the company over to bankruptcy <https://apnews.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud-timeline-be13e3fc0e074e2edd50ba59d1f8960e> lawyers, he maintained access to the exchange’s live trading records. “This cannot get out right now,” Bankman-Fried told Silver.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/nate-silver-sam-bankman-fried-sam-altman-openai-ftx-ai/\n\nSource 4:\nBankman-Fried was her \'Kryptonite\'\n\nEllison\'s downfall has become the subject of morbid fascination over the past two years, as the public has picked over the collapse of FTX, once valued at $32 billion, and its inner circle of 20 and 30-something executives, many of whom dated or counted each other as lifelong friends. \n\nEllison joined Bankman-Fried\'s orbit as a trader at his hedge fund Alameda Research at just 24 years old, and soon becoming its CEO. As she acknowledged during three days of emotional testimony during Bankman-Fried\'s trial last fall, she also played a crucial role in the fraud that took down the empire, with FTX funneling billions in dollars of customer assets to fund disastrous trades at Alameda, along with luxury real estate, illegal campaign donations, and venture investments.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ellison admitted once again that she should have stopped the fraud sooner, but she was unable to, drawn in by what she describes as her admiration—and often unrequited love—of Bankman-Fried.

2024-11-08 06:50:33,859: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, went bankrupt due to a combination of factors, primarily driven by the actions of its founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. According to reports, Bankman-Fried and other top executives at FTX looted customer accounts to make risky investments, millions of dollars of illegal political donations, bribe Chinese officials, and buy luxury real estate in the Caribbean [8]. This misuse of customer funds led to a significant shortfall in the company's assets, ultimately resulting in its collapse.

One of the key factors that contributed to FTX's downfall was its relationship with Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency hedge fund controlled by Bankman-Fried. Alameda Research was used to process some customer funds from FTX, and as the business began to falter, Caroline Ellison, the CEO of Alameda Research, divulged the massive fraud to employees who worked for her, even before FTX filed for bankruptcy [8]. This highlights the close ties between FTX and Alameda Research, which ultimately led to the downfall of both companies.

2024-11-08 06:50:34,293: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, went bankrupt due to a combination of factors, primarily driven by the actions of its founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. According to reports, Bankman-Fried and other top executives at FTX looted customer accounts to make risky investments, millions of dollars of illegal political donations, bribe Chinese officials, and buy luxury real estate in the Caribbean [8]. This misuse of customer funds led to a significant shortfall in the company's assets, ultimately resulting in its collapse.

One of the key factors that contributed to FTX's downfall was its relationship with Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency hedge fund controlled by Bankman-Fried. Alameda Research was used to process some customer funds from FTX, and as the business began to falter, Caroline Ellison, the CEO of Alameda Research, divulged the massive fraud to employees who worked for her, even before FTX filed for bankruptcy [8]. This highlights the close ties between FTX and Alameda Research, which ultimately led to the downfall of both companies.

The collapse of FTX marked the peak of a long "Crypto Winter," during which various scandals brought disrepute to the entire cryptocurrency industry [5]. The company's failure was also attributed to Bankman-Fried's risk tolerance and state of mind, which was described

2024-11-08 06:50:34,748: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, went bankrupt due to a combination of factors, primarily driven by the actions of its founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. According to reports, Bankman-Fried and other top executives at FTX looted customer accounts to make risky investments, millions of dollars of illegal political donations, bribe Chinese officials, and buy luxury real estate in the Caribbean [8]. This misuse of customer funds led to a significant shortfall in the company's assets, ultimately resulting in its collapse.

One of the key factors that contributed to FTX's downfall was its relationship with Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency hedge fund controlled by Bankman-Fried. Alameda Research was used to process some customer funds from FTX, and as the business began to falter, Caroline Ellison, the CEO of Alameda Research, divulged the massive fraud to employees who worked for her, even before FTX filed for bankruptcy [8]. This highlights the close ties between FTX and Alameda Research, which ultimately led to the downfall of both companies.

The collapse of FTX marked the peak of a long "Crypto Winter," during which various scandals brought disrepute to the entire cryptocurrency industry [5]. The company's failure was also attributed to Bankman-Fried's risk tolerance and state of mind, which was described as "terrible at risk assessment"

2024-11-08 06:50:35,083: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, went bankrupt due to a combination of factors, primarily driven by the actions of its founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. According to reports, Bankman-Fried and other top executives at FTX looted customer accounts to make risky investments, millions of dollars of illegal political donations, bribe Chinese officials, and buy luxury real estate in the Caribbean [8]. This misuse of customer funds led to a significant shortfall in the company's assets, ultimately resulting in its collapse.

One of the key factors that contributed to FTX's downfall was its relationship with Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency hedge fund controlled by Bankman-Fried. Alameda Research was used to process some customer funds from FTX, and as the business began to falter, Caroline Ellison, the CEO of Alameda Research, divulged the massive fraud to employees who worked for her, even before FTX filed for bankruptcy [8]. This highlights the close ties between FTX and Alameda Research, which ultimately led to the downfall of both companies.

The collapse of FTX marked the peak of a long "Crypto Winter," during which various scandals brought disrepute to the entire cryptocurrency industry [5]. The company's failure was also attributed to Bankman-Fried's risk tolerance and state of mind, which was described as "terrible at risk assessment" and "willing to gamble it all" [3].

2024-11-08 06:50:35,446: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, went bankrupt due to a combination of factors, primarily driven by the actions of its founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. According to reports, Bankman-Fried and other top executives at FTX looted customer accounts to make risky investments, millions of dollars of illegal political donations, bribe Chinese officials, and buy luxury real estate in the Caribbean [8]. This misuse of customer funds led to a significant shortfall in the company's assets, ultimately resulting in its collapse.

One of the key factors that contributed to FTX's downfall was its relationship with Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency hedge fund controlled by Bankman-Fried. Alameda Research was used to process some customer funds from FTX, and as the business began to falter, Caroline Ellison, the CEO of Alameda Research, divulged the massive fraud to employees who worked for her, even before FTX filed for bankruptcy [8]. This highlights the close ties between FTX and Alameda Research, which ultimately led to the downfall of both companies.

The collapse of FTX marked the peak of a long "Crypto Winter," during which various scandals brought disrepute to the entire cryptocurrency industry [5]. The company's failure was also attributed to Bankman-Fried's risk tolerance and state of mind, which was described as "terrible at risk assessment" and "willing to gamble it all" [3]. This reckless approach to risk management ultimately led to the collapse of FTX, which was once valued at over $30 billion [1].
