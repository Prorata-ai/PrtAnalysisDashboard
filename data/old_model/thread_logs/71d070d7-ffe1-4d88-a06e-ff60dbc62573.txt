In its broader applications, blockchain provides the technical underpinnings for an entirely new approach to the internet. \n\nThis new internet architecture, often referred to as web3, represents a new social contract. Web3 blockchains empower and are owned by individuals, whether consumers or creators—rather than leaving them and their data at the mercy of dominant players like Microsoft/OpenAI, Google, and all those other LLM developers treating our data as raw material for their business models. \n\nBlockchains are essentially a system of contracts operating as a public, immutable ledger that can protect intellectual property. Every creation can be permanently time-stamped and attributed to its rightful owner. This safeguards artists’ work from unauthorized use while also allowing them to maintain control over their intellectual property, tracking its use in training LLMs, and even enabling transparent royalty sharing for newly created works.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/04/ai-change-music-industry-apple-tech-entertainment/\n\nSource 5:\nGood morning.\nWe all think about cybersecurity for different reasons.

In its broader applications, blockchain provides the technical underpinnings for an entirely new approach to the internet. \n\nThis new internet architecture, often referred to as web3, represents a new social contract.

Every creation can be permanently time-stamped and attributed to its rightful owner. This safeguards artists’ work from unauthorized use while also allowing them to maintain control over their intellectual property, tracking its use in training LLMs, and even enabling transparent royalty sharing for newly created works.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/04/ai-change-music-industry-apple-tech-entertainment/\n\nSource 5:\nGood morning.\nWe all think about cybersecurity for different reasons.

In its broader applications, blockchain provides the technical underpinnings for an entirely new approach to the internet. \n\nThis new internet architecture, often referred to as web3, represents a new social contract. Web3 blockchains empower and are owned by individuals, whether consumers or creators—rather than leaving them and their data at the mercy of dominant players like Microsoft/OpenAI, Google, and all those other LLM developers treating our data as raw material for their business models. \n\nBlockchains are essentially a system of contracts operating as a public, immutable ledger that can protect intellectual property. Every creation can be permanently time-stamped and attributed to its rightful owner. This safeguards artists’ work from unauthorized use while also allowing them to maintain control over their intellectual property, tracking its use in training LLMs, and even enabling transparent royalty sharing for newly created works.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/04/ai-change-music-industry-apple-tech-entertainment/\n\nSource 5:\nGood morning.\nWe all think about cybersecurity for different reasons.
