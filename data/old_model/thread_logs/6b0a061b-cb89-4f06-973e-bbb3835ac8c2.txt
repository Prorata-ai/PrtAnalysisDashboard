Ballmer had a big hand in shaping Microsoft\'s take-no-prisoners corporate culture during its meteoric rise, which made him a billionaire several times over. The surprise is what he\'s done in the four years since Gates made him CEO. You\'d have expected more rabble-rousing, and there\'s been plenty of that. Yet at the same time Ballmer has steered Microsoft through the tech bust (Gates, with impeccable timing, made the handoff just three months before the dot-com bubble burst). Even as the rest of IT shrank, Microsoft continued to grow and to maintain prodigious operating profits of more than 35%. More important, Ballmer has put his stamp on the company. After an admittedly tentative first year as CEO, he embarked on a methodical campaign to rewrite Microsoft\'s corporate "operating system" from top to bottom. He\'s taken an unwieldy, overcentralized company that flew by the seat of Bill Gates\' pants, and broken it into seven operating divisions to push decision-making and', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.69854265), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='78b925c9-0ae7-4388-99aa-d4b14f62c05e', embedding=None, metadata={'id': '89aea546022d4aeef2990f8b1d582acd586debac86bab4e0c0f4171a938b51c3-7', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': '89aea546022d4aeef2990f8b1d582acd586debac86bab4e0c0f4171a938b51c3', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20040126, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-08', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fortune-logo-1600x900-white.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2004, 'date_month': 1, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/article/ballmer-unbound-fortune-2004/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 26, 'title': 'Ballmer unbound', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/article/ballmer-unbound-fortune-2004/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='billion now.) A notorious penny-pincher and control freak, Gates was also an instinctive entrepreneur and company builder. "Bill masterminded all of this--from an unmanaged, wild startup to a company that never had a bad quarter in 28 years," says Vaskevitch. So it\'s not surprising that Gates is a little defensive about the state of the company when he stepped down: "It\'s not as if when Steve took over there were receipts all over the place and everything was out of control." Ask senior Microsoft lieutenants how they felt, though, and some paint a bleaker picture. "It was a much tougher period than most people realize," says CFO John Connors--the Internet craze, by causing business to boom, helped hide the problems. Windows development chief Jim Allchin is blunter: "It was very frustrating. There were a few of us saying, \'It\'s not working, it\'s not working, it\'s not working.\' Not only people like me, but on down, because we just couldn\'t scale" to meet the demands of crucial software development projects.

Barrel- chested and bombastic, he\'s always been the quintessential, larger-than-life, rah-rah leader, and the perfect foil for his geeky and erudite best buddy, Bill Gates. Stories abound of his over-the-top antics rallying Microsoft\'s troops at corporate events: There was the infamous Monkey-Boy dance he performed at a sales meeting a few years ago, which prompted dozens of incredulous Microsoft bashers to post choppy videoclips of his cavortings on the web; or the surgery he endured to repair blown-out vocal cords resulting from a bout of unrestrained cheerleading; or the outlandish hula-girl and used-car-salesman costumes he gleefully donned to get a laugh and make a point.

Ballmer had a big hand in shaping Microsoft\'s take-no-prisoners corporate culture during its meteoric rise, which made him a billionaire several times over. The surprise is what he\'s done in the four years since Gates made him CEO. You\'d have expected more rabble-rousing, and there\'s been plenty of that. Yet at the same time Ballmer has steered Microsoft through the tech bust (Gates, with impeccable timing, made the handoff just three months before the dot-com bubble burst). Even as the rest of IT shrank, Microsoft continued to grow and to maintain prodigious operating profits of more than 35%. More important, Ballmer has put his stamp on the company. After an admittedly tentative first year as CEO, he embarked on a methodical campaign to rewrite Microsoft\'s corporate "operating system" from top to bottom.

A notorious penny-pincher and control freak, Gates was also an instinctive entrepreneur and company builder. "Bill masterminded all of this--from an unmanaged, wild startup to a company that never had a bad quarter in 28 years," says Vaskevitch. So it\'s not surprising that Gates is a little defensive about the state of the company when he stepped down: "It\'s not as if when Steve took over there were receipts all over the place and everything was out of control." Ask senior Microsoft lieutenants how they felt, though, and some paint a bleaker picture.

Ballmer had a big hand in shaping Microsoft\'s take-no-prisoners corporate culture during its meteoric rise, which made him a billionaire several times over. The surprise is what he\'s done in the four years since Gates made him CEO. You\'d have expected more rabble-rousing, and there\'s been plenty of that. Yet at the same time Ballmer has steered Microsoft through the tech bust (Gates, with impeccable timing, made the handoff just three months before the dot-com bubble burst). Even as the rest of IT shrank, Microsoft continued to grow and to maintain prodigious operating profits of more than 35%. More important, Ballmer has put his stamp on the company. After an admittedly tentative first year as CEO, he embarked on a methodical campaign to rewrite Microsoft\'s corporate "operating system" from top to bottom.

A notorious penny-pincher and control freak, Gates was also an instinctive entrepreneur and company builder. "Bill masterminded all of this--from an unmanaged, wild startup to a company that never had a bad quarter in 28 years," says Vaskevitch. So it\'s not surprising that Gates is a little defensive about the state of the company when he stepped down: "It\'s not as if when Steve took over there were receipts all over the place and everything was out of control."

This week we turn to a 2004 Fortune profile of Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/> CEO Steve Ballmer, who will retire within the next 12 months after more than 30 years at the company.

Ballmer had a big hand in shaping Microsoft\'s take-no-prisoners corporate culture during its meteoric rise, which made him a billionaire several times over. The surprise is what he\'s done in the four years since Gates made him CEO. You\'d have expected more rabble-rousing, and there\'s been plenty of that. Yet at the same time Ballmer has steered Microsoft through the tech bust (Gates, with impeccable timing, made the handoff just three months before the dot-com bubble burst). Even as the rest of IT shrank, Microsoft continued to grow and to maintain prodigious operating profits of more than 35%. More important, Ballmer has put his stamp on the company. After an admittedly tentative first year as CEO, he embarked on a methodical campaign to rewrite Microsoft\'s corporate "operating system" from top to bottom. He\'s taken an unwieldy, overcentralized company that flew by the seat of Bill Gates\' pants, and broken it into seven operating divisions to push decision-making and\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/ballmer-unbound-fortune-2004/\n\nSource 1:\nbillion now.) A notorious penny-pincher and control freak, Gates was also an instinctive entrepreneur and company builder. "Bill masterminded all of this--from an unmanaged, wild startup to a company that never had a bad quarter in 28 years," says Vaskevitch. So it\'s not surprising that Gates is a little defensive about the state of the company when he stepped down: "It\'s not as if when Steve took over there were receipts all over the place and everything was out of control." Ask senior Microsoft lieutenants how they felt, though, and some paint a bleaker picture. "It was a much tougher period than most people realize," says CFO John Connors--the Internet craze, by causing business to boom, helped hide the problems. Windows development chief Jim Allchin is blunter: "It was very frustrating. There were a few of us saying, \'It\'s not working, it\'s not working, it\'s not working.\' Not only people like me, but on down, because we just couldn\'t scale" to meet the demands of crucial software development projects.

Barrel- chested and bombastic, he\'s always been the quintessential, larger-than-life, rah-rah leader, and the perfect foil for his geeky and erudite best buddy, Bill Gates. Stories abound of his over-the-top antics rallying Microsoft\'s troops at corporate events: There was the infamous Monkey-Boy dance he performed at a sales meeting a few years ago, which prompted dozens of incredulous Microsoft bashers to post choppy videoclips of his cavortings on the web; or the surgery he endured to repair blown-out vocal cords resulting from a bout of unrestrained cheerleading; or the outlandish hula-girl and used-car-salesman costumes he gleefully donned to get a laugh and make a point. On the Microsoft campus, you can always tell he\'s approaching by his sharp, punctuating claps as he barks orders to a subordinate trailing behind. And he\'s the first to admit that in his case, "table pounder" is literally apt. That noisy behavior served Ballmer--and Microsoft--quite well over more than two decades as Bill\'s go-to guy, whether it was as leader of the Windows software development team in the\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/ballmer-unbound-fortune-2004/\n\nSource 1:\nreligion. But then Microsoft has always been something of a cult. Not so much a cult of Bill worshippers, or Ballmerites, but an army of techno-zealots who genuinely believe that they can bend and mold software to solve any problem.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/article/ballmer-unbound-fortune-2004/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/ballmer-unbound-fortune-2004/\n\nSource 2:\nToday is Bill Gates\' birthday. And it was 49 years ago this spring that he and Paul Allen founded Microsoft—a company that has had a lasting impression and impact on the software industry, and Big Tech itself. \n\nTo build such a successful company, which now boasts a whopping $3.125 trillion market capitalization <https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-apple-stock-price-market-cap-value-663f1a30>, Gates rarely took breaks. In fact, he said that in the early days of Microsoft, he really didn’t even believe in them, Gates told Northern Arizona University <https://www.gatesnotes.com/Why-I-am-Going-to-NAU>’s graduating class in 2023.\n\n“When I was your age, I didn\'t believe in vacations. I didn\'t even believe in weekends,” said Gates <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxQV3ZLyT0M>, who was about 20 years old when he started Microsoft. “I pushed everyone around me to work very long hours.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/microsoft-founder-bill-gates-birthday-how-company-started-timeless-leadership-advice-work-ethic/\n\nSource 3:\nGiving away money\n\nGates’ major philanthropic donations also factor in. As of 2023, Gates and his ex-wife Melinda French Gates had donated $59.5 billion <https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/foundation-fact-sheet> to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, turning it into the one of the world’s largest charitable foundations. In 2010, Gates also cocreated the Giving Pledge <https://givingpledge.org/about> with French Gates and investor Warren Buffett, and has promised to give away most of his wealth during his lifetime. \n\nAlthough Steve Ballmer’s holdings have made him one of the richest men in the world, when he joined as the company’s 30th employee in 1980, he didn’t get a single share. After dropping out of Stanford Business School, he served as a quasi–personal assistant to Bill Gates with the unimpressive title “business manager,” Forbes reported.\n\nYet, because Microsoft was looking to grow rapidly at the time, Gates and his cofounder, Paul Allen, agreed to give Ballmer 10% of the profit growth he generated on top of his $50,000 yearly salary.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/steve-ballmer-net-worth-bill-gates-sixth-richest-man-microsoft/\n\nSource 3:\nWhen Steve Ballmer joined Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/> he didn’t get a single company share. But now, his skyrocketing Microsoft holdings <https://fortune.com/2024/06/20/nvidia-stock-price-microsoft-intel-forecast/> have made him richer than the company’s founder.\n\nThe 68-year-old former Microsoft CEO squeaked by his onetime boss Bill Gates to become the sixth richest person <https://fortune.com/2024/03/24/microsofts-steve-ballmer-was-once-bill-gates-assistant-now-the-sixth-richest-person-in-the-world-here-are-his-5-tips-for-success/> in the world on Monday with a net worth of $157 billion.

"And I was willing to focus my life, in my 20s, just on software, just on the one job."\n\nIn fact, he and Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen had a vision of putting a PC on every desk and in every home, "which sounds boring today, but back then [it] was completely crazy," Gates added.\n\nLooking back on those early years, he characterized his view of success as "very much Microsoft-centric," describing his life during his 20s as "all Microsoft, all the time."\n\nGates stepped down as CEO in 2000, gave up his day-to-day duties in 2008, relinquished his chairmanship role in 2014, and left the board in 2020. Now focused on his philanthropy, he said his definition of success has evolved and includes "adding net value" to the world as well as empowering other people.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/15/bill-gates-keys-success-early-microsoft-growth-founder-work-life-balance/\n\nSource 4:\nMicrosoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/> cofounder Bill Gates looked at the big picture and the small picture as he was growing his software company in the early years.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC\'s Make It <https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/11/bill-gates-shares-how-he-grew-microsoft-i-focused-my-life-on-one-job.html> published on Wednesday, the tech billionaire revealed that his definition of success included his software and its global impact.\n\n"Back then, it was just: Is my code really good? Does it work? And can this company show the world that these microcomputers are big?" Gates said.\n\nHis view also spoke to his evangelism about the potential of personal computers to transform business and society. While the PC\'s impact is clear now, it wasn\'t obvious to everyone four decades ago, even to some of the early innovators.\n\nIn 1981, IBM <https://fortune.com/company/ibm/> launched its PC and famously estimated that it would only sell 241,683 units over a five-year period. Instead, it sold about 3 million in that time and hundreds of millions over a decade.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/15/bill-gates-keys-success-early-microsoft-growth-founder-work-life-balance/\n\nSource 5:\nBill Gates <https://fortune.com/tag/bill-gates/> is one of the most revered—yet most intense—business leaders in history. Gates, along with Paul Allen, founded Microsoft—a company that has had a lasting impact on the software industry, and Big Tech itself. Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/> now boasts a $3.1 trillion market capitalization.\nDuring his tenure building Microsoft, Gates infamously “didn’t believe in vacations <https://fortune.com/2024/04/04/bill-gates-microsoft-tips-business-success/>” and worked on weekends. That same level of intensity allegedly bled into the philanthropic foundation he created with his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates <https://fortune.com/tag/melinda-gates/>, according to an excerpt <https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-melinda-gates-stressful-work-culture-gates-foundation-book-excerpt-2024-8> from Billionaire, Nerd, Savior, King: Bill Gates and His Quest to Shape Our World\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/16/bill-gates-terrified-employees-at-foundation-anupreeta-das-book-claims/\n\nSource 6:\nBill Gates famously dropped out of Harvard to cofound Microsoft with Paul Allen, a childhood friend. They were excited by the prospects of creating software for a new concept, the personal computer, also called a microcomputer. They launched Microsoft in 1975. \nGates cover: July 21, 1986 Grove cover: February 17, 1997 Joba and Gates cover: August 26, 1991 \nThe two companies’ paths crossed when IBM <https://fortune.com/company/ibm/> decided in 1980 to produce a PC and wanted to move fast by using existing chips and an existing operating system developed by others.

This week we turn to a 2004 Fortune profile of Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/> CEO Steve Ballmer, who will retire within the next 12 months after more than 30 years at the company.

Ballmer had a big hand in shaping Microsoft\'s take-no-prisoners corporate culture during its meteoric rise, which made him a billionaire several times over. The surprise is what he\'s done in the four years since Gates made him CEO. You\'d have expected more rabble-rousing, and there\'s been plenty of that. Yet at the same time Ballmer has steered Microsoft through the tech bust (Gates, with impeccable timing, made the handoff just three months before the dot-com bubble burst). Even as the rest of IT shrank, Microsoft continued to grow and to maintain prodigious operating profits of more than 35%. More important, Ballmer has put his stamp on the company. After an admittedly tentative first year as CEO, he embarked on a methodical campaign to rewrite Microsoft\'s corporate "operating system" from top to bottom. He\'s taken an unwieldy, overcentralized company that flew by the seat of Bill Gates\' pants, and broken it into seven operating divisions to push decision-making and\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/ballmer-unbound-fortune-2004/\n\nSource 1:\nbillion now.) A notorious penny-pincher and control freak, Gates was also an instinctive entrepreneur and company builder. "Bill masterminded all of this--from an unmanaged, wild startup to a company that never had a bad quarter in 28 years," says Vaskevitch. So it\'s not surprising that Gates is a little defensive about the state of the company when he stepped down: "It\'s not as if when Steve took over there were receipts all over the place and everything was out of control." Ask senior Microsoft lieutenants how they felt, though, and some paint a bleaker picture. "It was a much tougher period than most people realize," says CFO John Connors--the Internet craze, by causing business to boom, helped hide the problems. Windows development chief Jim Allchin is blunter: "It was very frustrating. There were a few of us saying, \'It\'s not working, it\'s not working, it\'s not working.\' Not only people like me, but on down, because we just couldn\'t scale" to meet the demands of crucial software development projects.

Barrel- chested and bombastic, he\'s always been the quintessential, larger-than-life, rah-rah leader, and the perfect foil for his geeky and erudite best buddy, Bill Gates. Stories abound of his over-the-top antics rallying Microsoft\'s troops at corporate events: There was the infamous Monkey-Boy dance he performed at a sales meeting a few years ago, which prompted dozens of incredulous Microsoft bashers to post choppy videoclips of his cavortings on the web; or the surgery he endured to repair blown-out vocal cords resulting from a bout of unrestrained cheerleading; or the outlandish hula-girl and used-car-salesman costumes he gleefully donned to get a laugh and make a point. On the Microsoft campus, you can always tell he\'s approaching by his sharp, punctuating claps as he barks orders to a subordinate trailing behind. And he\'s the first to admit that in his case, "table pounder" is literally apt. That noisy behavior served Ballmer--and Microsoft--quite well over more than two decades as Bill\'s go-to guy, whether it was as leader of the Windows software development team in the\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/ballmer-unbound-fortune-2004/\n\nSource 1:\nreligion. But then Microsoft has always been something of a cult. Not so much a cult of Bill worshippers, or Ballmerites, but an army of techno-zealots who genuinely believe that they can bend and mold software to solve any problem.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/article/ballmer-unbound-fortune-2004/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/ballmer-unbound-fortune-2004/\n\nSource 2:\nToday is Bill Gates\' birthday. And it was 49 years ago this spring that he and Paul Allen founded Microsoft—a company that has had a lasting impression and impact on the software industry, and Big Tech itself. \n\nTo build such a successful company, which now boasts a whopping $3.125 trillion market capitalization <https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-apple-stock-price-market-cap-value-663f1a30>, Gates rarely took breaks. In fact, he said that in the early days of Microsoft, he really didn’t even believe in them, Gates told Northern Arizona University <https://www.gatesnotes.com/Why-I-am-Going-to-NAU>’s graduating class in 2023.\n\n“When I was your age, I didn\'t believe in vacations. I didn\'t even believe in weekends,” said Gates <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxQV3ZLyT0M>, who was about 20 years old when he started Microsoft. “I pushed everyone around me to work very long hours.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/microsoft-founder-bill-gates-birthday-how-company-started-timeless-leadership-advice-work-ethic/\n\nSource 3:\nGiving away money\n\nGates’ major philanthropic donations also factor in. As of 2023, Gates and his ex-wife Melinda French Gates had donated $59.5 billion <https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/foundation-fact-sheet> to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, turning it into the one of the world’s largest charitable foundations. In 2010, Gates also cocreated the Giving Pledge <https://givingpledge.org/about> with French Gates and investor Warren Buffett, and has promised to give away most of his wealth during his lifetime. \n\nAlthough Steve Ballmer’s holdings have made him one of the richest men in the world, when he joined as the company’s 30th employee in 1980, he didn’t get a single share. After dropping out of Stanford Business School, he served as a quasi–personal assistant to Bill Gates with the unimpressive title “business manager,” Forbes reported.\n\nYet, because Microsoft was looking to grow rapidly at the time, Gates and his cofounder, Paul Allen, agreed to give Ballmer 10% of the profit growth he generated on top of his $50,000 yearly salary.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/steve-ballmer-net-worth-bill-gates-sixth-richest-man-microsoft/\n\nSource 3:\nWhen Steve Ballmer joined Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/> he didn’t get a single company share.

2024-11-08 06:42:28,591: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The founder of Microsoft is Bill Gates. According to Source 2, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft 49 years ago, and the company has had a lasting impression and impact on the software industry and Big Tech itself [2]. Gates was about 20 years old when he started Microsoft, and he has said that in the early days of the company, he didn't believe in vacations or weekends, pushing everyone around him to work very long hours [2]. This intense work ethic helped shape Microsoft into the successful company it is today, with a market capitalization of $3.125 trillion [2].

Bill Gates' vision for Microsoft was to put a PC on every desk and in every home, which was a "completely crazy" idea at the time, but one that he and Paul Allen were committed to [4]. Gates has said that his definition of success in the early years of Microsoft was "very much Microsoft-centric," and that his life was "all Microsoft, all the time" [4]. This focus

2024-11-08 06:42:29,812: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The founder of Microsoft is Bill Gates. According to Source 2, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft 49 years ago, and the company has had a lasting impression and impact on the software industry and Big Tech itself [2]. Gates was about 20 years old when he started Microsoft, and he has said that in the early days of the company, he didn't believe in vacations or weekends, pushing everyone around him to work very long hours [2]. This intense work ethic helped shape Microsoft into the successful company it is today, with a market capitalization of $3.125 trillion [2].

Bill Gates' vision for Microsoft was to put a PC on every desk and in every home, which was a "completely crazy" idea at the time, but one that he and Paul Allen were committed to [4]. Gates has said that his definition of success in the early years of Microsoft was "very much Microsoft-centric," and that his life was "all Microsoft, all the time" [4]. This focus and dedication helped drive the company's success and established Gates as one of the most revered business leaders in history [5].

Under Gates' leadership, Microsoft became a dominant player in the software industry, and its partnership with Intel helped establish the "Wintel" standard for PCs, which swept America and the world [6]. Today,

2024-11-08 06:42:30,269: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The founder of Microsoft is Bill Gates. According to Source 2, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft 49 years ago, and the company has had a lasting impression and impact on the software industry and Big Tech itself [2]. Gates was about 20 years old when he started Microsoft, and he has said that in the early days of the company, he didn't believe in vacations or weekends, pushing everyone around him to work very long hours [2]. This intense work ethic helped shape Microsoft into the successful company it is today, with a market capitalization of $3.125 trillion [2].

Bill Gates' vision for Microsoft was to put a PC on every desk and in every home, which was a "completely crazy" idea at the time, but one that he and Paul Allen were committed to [4]. Gates has said that his definition of success in the early years of Microsoft was "very much Microsoft-centric," and that his life was "all Microsoft, all the time" [4]. This focus and dedication helped drive the company's success and established Gates as one of the most revered business leaders in history [5].

Under Gates' leadership, Microsoft became a dominant player in the software industry, and its partnership with Intel helped establish the "Wintel" standard for PCs, which swept America and the world [6]. Today, Microsoft is one of the largest and most successful companies in the world, and Bill Gates is widely recognized as one of the most successful entrepreneurs in history [2

2024-11-08 06:42:30,283: ObserveEventsHandler(  207): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd response: assistant: The founder of Microsoft is Bill Gates. According to Source 2, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft 49 years ago, and the company has had a lasting impression and impact on the software industry and Big Tech itself [2]. Gates was about 20 years old when he started Microsoft, and he has said that in the early days of the company, he didn't believe in vacations or weekends, pushing everyone around him to work very long hours [2]. This intense work ethic helped shape Microsoft into the successful company it is today, with a market capitalization of $3.125 trillion [2].

Bill Gates' vision for Microsoft was to put a PC on every desk and in every home, which was a "completely crazy" idea at the time, but one that he and Paul Allen were committed to [4]. Gates has said that his definition of success in the early years of Microsoft was "very much Microsoft-centric," and that his life was "all Microsoft, all the time" [4]. This focus and dedication helped drive the company's success and established Gates as one of the most revered business leaders in history [5].

Under Gates' leadership, Microsoft became a dominant player in the software industry, and its partnership with Intel helped establish the "Wintel" standard for PCs, which swept America and the world [6]. Today, Microsoft is one of the largest and most successful companies in the world, and Bill Gates is widely recognized as one of the most successful entrepreneurs in history [2].
