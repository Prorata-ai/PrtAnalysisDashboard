He put up $91,000, secured a line of credit, and later raised some $600,000 from venture capitalists. Markkula became chairman of the company in May 1977, and Michael Scott, 37, signed on as president a month later, taking a 50% pay cut from his job as a director of manufacturing at National Semiconductor. You don\'t need an Apple computer to tell you that at least four new multimillionaires are now roaming the Silicon Valley.

That was a year of triage, of a humbling investment from Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/>, of paring Apple\'s product line to a bare minimum of four computers. By the following year Steve\'s regime had kicked into gear. Jobs completed the hiring of a new management team, which included several executives from his previous company, Next. Those top players would form the nucleus of the Jobs brain trust for nearly 10 years. Then came the first Macintosh after Jobs\' return, the iMac, a breakthrough all-in-one computer and monitor that heralded Apple\'s return to health. The success of the pricey iMac, coupled with drastic cost cutting, allowed Jobs to build a cash cushion.

Still, he faced resistance even while developing innovative computer programs “at a time when there were no books on the subject,” he said. \n\nHe made a decision: “I knew computers by heart. I decided I wanted a computer of my own that I could decide what to do with it.”\n\nThe goal for that computer, he said, was to “help other human beings do more with their lives than they could do without a computer, and not to rely on million-dollar mainframes that companies and universities could afford.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/11/steve-wozniak-boulder-university-commencement-speech-war-protests-students-advice/\n\nSource 2:\nThat dream was soon realized. In 1976, Wozniak built out the first versions <https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak> of Apple’s personal computers, and the following year, the company released the Apple II, one of the earliest personal computers available to the general public, which was met with huge commercial success <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/1977-apple-ii-breakthrough-personal-computers-robert-lavigne/>. In 1985, Wozniak left his role at Apple to find an engineering role that didn’t also involve running a fast-growing business, selling much of his Apple stock upon his departure, according to Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak>.\n\nSince then, Wozniak has leaned into the country’s education system, spending eight years teaching fifth grade. He presented the graduating class with some advice he has collected from all of that experience: “You grow up in education to be leaders, not followers. Think for yourself and decide what’s right and wrong.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/11/steve-wozniak-boulder-university-commencement-speech-war-protests-students-advice/\n\nSource 3:\nThe "decade" of Steve actually began in 1997, when he returned to Apple after having been ousted a dozen years earlier. That was a year of triage, of a humbling investment from Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/>, of paring Apple\'s product line to a bare minimum of four computers. By the following year Steve\'s regime had kicked into gear. Jobs completed the hiring of a new management team, which included several executives from his previous company, Next. Those top players would form the nucleus of the Jobs brain trust for nearly 10 years. Then came the first Macintosh after Jobs\' return, the iMac, a breakthrough all-in-one computer and monitor that heralded Apple\'s return to health. The success of the pricey iMac, coupled with drastic cost cutting, allowed Jobs to build a cash cushion. By repairing Apple\'s balance sheet, he prepared the company for big investments to come, a shrewd business move if ever there was one. Jobs laid the foundation for Apple\'s leap from stable to stratospheric when things looked darkest. In 2000, Apple missed its financial targets in a September earnings announcement, sending its stock price plummeting in subsequent months to the equivalent of $7 in today\'s\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/decade-steve-jobs-apple/\n\nSource 3:\nannouncement, sending its stock price plummeting in subsequent months to the equivalent of $7 in today\'s prices. Yet Jobs by this time had set in motion the key elements of Apple\'s rejuvenation. Over the course of 2001, as global markets fell and the world headed into recession, Apple launched the iTunes music software (in January), the Mac OS X <https://fortune.com/company/twitter/> operating system (March), the first Apple retail stores (May), and the first iPod (November), a 5GB model that Apple bragged would hold 1,000 songs.\n<https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/decade-of-steve-3-e1475163808321.jpg>Click image to enlarge.photos, from lefT: Justin Sullivan—Getty Images; David Paul Morris—Getty Images; Gary Reyes—MCT/Landovphotos, from lefT: Justin Sullivan—Getty Images; David Paul Morris—Getty Images; Gary Reyes—MCT/Landov\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/decade-steve-jobs-apple/\n\nSource 3:\nThe financial results have been nothing short of astounding—for Apple and for Jobs. The company was worth about $5 billion in 2000, just before Jobs unleashed Apple\'s groundbreaking "digital lifestyle" strategy, understood at the time by few critics. Today, at about $170 billion, Apple is slightly more valuable than Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/>. Its market share in personal computers was plummeting back then, and the cash drain was so severe that bankruptcy was a possibility. Now Apple has $34 billion in cash and marketable securities, surpassing the total market cap of rival Dell <https://fortune.com/company/dell-technologies/>. Macintoshes make up 9% of the PC market in the U.S. today, but that share is increasingly beside the point. With 275 retail stores in nine countries, a 73% share of the U.S. MP3 player market, and the undisputed leadership position in innovation when it comes to mobile phones, Apple and its CEO are no one\'s idea of underdogs anymore. In 2006 Disney <https://fortune.com/company/disney/> paid $7.5 billion to acquire Pixar, the computer animation film studio Jobs had nurtured and controlled.

Graduates of Santa Clara\'s Homestead High School, Jobs and Wozniak dropped out of college. The self-taught computer whizzes went to work for local electronics companies. The two began collaborating five years ago at the Home Brew Computer Club in Palo Alto. They designed their first machine in Jobs\'s bedroom, built it in his parents\' garage, and showed it to a local computer-store owner, who promptly ordered 25. Demand for the "personal" computer, mainly from hobbyists, soon outstripped the young men\'s ability to produce, so they began looking for help. Enter A. C. Markkula Jr.,\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/folks-who-brought-you-apple/\n\nSource 1:\nJobs\'s $165 million. Wozniak spread the wealth among his relatives. His parents and siblings own nearly $3 million in Apple stock. His wife, Alice, owns $27 million. They are separated. —Grant F. Winthrop Something out of the Depression From those days they learned to stay small and keep overhead down. Hambrecht & Quist\'s scruffy quarters look like government offices in the Depression. No Eames chairs, no Kirman carpets, no Touch-Tone telephones. The staff totals 90, with only three professionals in the syndicate department and five in corporate finance. Employees are treated more like entrepreneurs than hired hands. Institutional salesmen have to pay half their expenses, including secretaries\' salaries, telephone calls, and airplane tickets. Analysts not only write research reports but also help put together prospectuses and study venture-capital deals. They earn less than the industry average in base salary, but can cash in on hefty bonuses depending on their contribution to profits. The annual paycheck for an analyst can run as high as $300,000. For more on Apple, watch this Fortune video:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/folks-who-brought-you-apple/\n\nSource 2:\nTo be fair, Wozniak was expelled from the school after his first year for hacking into the school’s network and sending prank messages <https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/21/steve-wozniak-school-is-not-enough-go-beyond-it.html>. Still, he faced resistance even while developing innovative computer programs “at a time when there were no books on the subject,” he said. \n\nHe made a decision: “I knew computers by heart. I decided I wanted a computer of my own that I could decide what to do with it.”\n\nThe goal for that computer, he said, was to “help other human beings do more with their lives than they could do without a computer, and not to rely on million-dollar mainframes that companies and universities could afford.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/11/steve-wozniak-boulder-university-commencement-speech-war-protests-students-advice/\n\nSource 2:\nThat dream was soon realized. In 1976, Wozniak built out the first versions <https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak> of Apple’s personal computers, and the following year, the company released the Apple II, one of the earliest personal computers available to the general public, which was met with huge commercial success <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/1977-apple-ii-breakthrough-personal-computers-robert-lavigne/>. In 1985, Wozniak left his role at Apple to find an engineering role that didn’t also involve running a fast-growing business, selling much of his Apple stock upon his departure, according to Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak>.\n\nSince then, Wozniak has leaned into the country’s education system, spending eight years teaching fifth grade. He presented the graduating class with some advice he has collected from all of that experience: “You grow up in education to be leaders, not followers. Think for yourself and decide what’s right and wrong.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/11/steve-wozniak-boulder-university-commencement-speech-war-protests-students-advice/\n\nSource 3:\nThe "decade" of Steve actually began in 1997, when he returned to Apple after having been ousted a dozen years earlier. That was a year of triage, of a humbling investment from Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/>, of paring Apple\'s product line to a bare minimum of four computers. By the following year Steve\'s regime had kicked into gear. Jobs completed the hiring of a new management team, which included several executives from his previous company, Next. Those top players would form the nucleus of the Jobs brain trust for nearly 10 years. Then came the first Macintosh after Jobs\' return, the iMac, a breakthrough all-in-one computer and monitor that heralded Apple\'s return to health. The success of the pricey iMac, coupled with drastic cost cutting, allowed Jobs to build a cash cushion. By repairing Apple\'s balance sheet, he prepared the company for big investments to come, a shrewd business move if ever there was one. Jobs laid the foundation for Apple\'s leap from stable to stratospheric when things looked darkest. In 2000, Apple missed its financial targets in a September earnings announcement, sending its stock price plummeting in subsequent months to the equivalent of $7 in today\'s\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/decade-steve-jobs-apple/\n\nSource 3:\nannouncement, sending its stock price plummeting in subsequent months to the equivalent of $7 in today\'s prices. Yet Jobs by this time had set in motion the key elements of Apple\'s rejuvenation. Over the course of 2001, as global markets fell and the world headed into recession, Apple launched the iTunes music software (in January), the Mac OS X <https://fortune.com/company/twitter/> operating system (March), the first Apple retail stores (May), and the first iPod (November), a 5GB model that Apple bragged would hold 1,000 songs.\n<https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/decade-of-steve-3-e1475163808321.jpg>Click image to enlarge.photos, from lefT: Justin Sullivan—Getty Images; David Paul Morris—Getty Images; Gary Reyes—MCT/Landovphotos, from lefT: Justin Sullivan—Getty Images; David Paul Morris—Getty Images; Gary Reyes—MCT/Landov\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/decade-steve-jobs-apple/\n\nSource 3:\nThe financial results have been nothing short of astounding—for Apple and for Jobs. The company was worth about $5 billion in 2000, just before Jobs unleashed Apple\'s groundbreaking "digital lifestyle" strategy, understood at the time by few critics. Today, at about $170 billion, Apple is slightly more valuable than Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/>. Its market share in personal computers was plummeting back then, and the cash drain was so severe that bankruptcy was a possibility. Now Apple has $34 billion in cash and marketable securities, surpassing the total market cap of rival Dell <https://fortune.com/company/dell-technologies/>. Macintoshes make up 9% of the PC market in the U.S. today, but that share is increasingly beside the point. With 275 retail stores in nine countries, a 73% share of the U.S. MP3 player market, and the undisputed leadership position in innovation when it comes to mobile phones, Apple and its CEO are no one\'s idea of underdogs anymore. In 2006 Disney <https://fortune.com/company/disney/> paid $7.5 billion to acquire Pixar, the computer animation film studio Jobs had nurtured and controlled.

Another ad proclaims: In the 90\'s we\'ll probably see only 10 real breakthroughs in computers. Here are seven of them.

"If it isn\'t possible for Steve Jobs to introduce a new computer, this becomes a boring business," says Stewart Alsop, the newsletter editor. For now, anyway, Jobs is getting his chance. He has his stylish-looking computer, plenty of money, a coterie of enthusiastic software developers—and the richest uncle in the computer business.

2024-11-08 06:42:47,007: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The company that Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne started is Apple Computer, although Ronald Wayne is not mentioned in the provided sources. According to the sources, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, graduates of Santa Clara's Homestead High School, began collaborating five years prior to the founding of Apple at the Home Brew Computer Club in Palo Alto [1]. They designed their first machine in Jobs's bedroom, built it in his parents' garage, and showed it to a local computer-store owner, who promptly ordered 25 [1]. This early success led to the formation of Apple Computer, which would go on to revolutionize the personal computer industry.

Steve Wozniak built out the first versions of Apple's personal computers in 1976, and the following year, the company released the Apple II, one of the earliest personal computers available to the general public, which was met with huge commercial success [2]. The success of the Apple II helped establish Apple as a major player in the burgeoning personal computer industry.

The sources do not mention Ronald Wayne as a co-founder of Apple Computer, but it is widely known that Ronald Wayne was indeed a co-founder of Apple, although he sold his 10% stake in the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 just a few months

The success of the Apple II helped establish Apple as a major player in the burgeoning personal computer industry.

The sources do not mention Ronald Wayne as a co-founder of Apple Computer, but it is widely known that Ronald Wayne was indeed a co-founder of Apple, although he sold his 10% stake in the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 just a few months after its founding.

2024-11-08 06:42:47,320: ObserveEventsHandler(  207): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd response: assistant: The company that Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne started is Apple Computer, although Ronald Wayne is not mentioned in the provided sources. According to the sources, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, graduates of Santa Clara's Homestead High School, began collaborating five years prior to the founding of Apple at the Home Brew Computer Club in Palo Alto [1]. They designed their first machine in Jobs's bedroom, built it in his parents' garage, and showed it to a local computer-store owner, who promptly ordered 25 [1]. This early success led to the formation of Apple Computer, which would go on to revolutionize the personal computer industry.

Steve Wozniak built out the first versions of Apple's personal computers in 1976, and the following year, the company released the Apple II, one of the earliest personal computers available to the general public, which was met with huge commercial success [2]. The success of the Apple II helped establish Apple as a major player in the burgeoning personal computer industry.

The sources do not mention Ronald Wayne as a co-founder of Apple Computer, but it is widely known that Ronald Wayne was indeed a co-founder of Apple, although he sold his 10% stake in the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 just a few months after its founding. Unfortunately, this information is not present in the provided sources.
