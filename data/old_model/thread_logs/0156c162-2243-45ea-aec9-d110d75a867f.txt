With over $25 billion made between books, movies, video games, and more, the boy wizard’s commercial franchise has far outshone and outlasted most pop-culture fads. \n\nFor Bloomsbury, the British publisher behind the series, it’s proven a massive cash cow, helping it become one of the world’s leading players. But it’s also been 27 years since the first J.K. Rowling–authored book was released (yes, it’s that old). \n\nSince then, genres have come and gone; e-books rose, fell, and then started rising again <https://wordsrated.com/ebooks-sales-statistics/>; and social media sites like TikTok upended the way many people discover books. Amid all these changes, Bloomsbury has been able to avoid becoming a one-wizard wonder, and its titles crowd bookstore windows to this day.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/30/book-publisher-bloomsbury-harry-potter-sarah-j-maas-record-sales-profits-fans-booktok/\n\nSource 1:\n“That shifts the emphasis on making money from her [Maas’s] back catalog, in the same way that Bloomsbury has managed to sweat its Harry Potter assets with new versions of the beloved book series,” AJ Bell’s investment director Russ Mould said. \n\n“The news is like a famous band saying they’re going on a hiatus—disappointment now, but the potential to make even more money when they return.”\n\nStill, Bloomsbury is confident it’ll rise above the tide. It’s set up a strong fan base with its core authors, who keep new and old readers coming, while leaving room to experiment with new and innovative ones. And with academic books in the mix, it has what CEO Newton calls a “resilient model” in the face of volatility that typifies creative industries.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/30/book-publisher-bloomsbury-harry-potter-sarah-j-maas-record-sales-profits-fans-booktok/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/30/book-publisher-bloomsbury-harry-potter-sarah-j-maas-record-sales-profits-fans-booktok/\n\nSource 1:\nAnd while peak Harry Potter mania may have long passed, its magic continues to draw Bloomsbury new business. For instance, last year the first Harry Potter was the U.K.’s No. 1 bestseller in children’s books for the first time since 2002 <https://www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk/financial/f_latest>. The London-listed company has also expanded the franchise with new books like the Wizarding Almanac.\n\nBut book publishing for the mass market isn’t all that Bloomsbury does. With its “game-changing” purchase of Rowman & Littlefield, an independent publisher whose authors cover topics like arts, humanities, and social science, Bloomsbury is leaning further into the realm of academic publishing, adding 40,000 titles to its existing roster and expanding into North America.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/30/book-publisher-bloomsbury-harry-potter-sarah-j-maas-record-sales-profits-fans-booktok/\n\nSource 2:\nThe three actors who previously landed these roles have become household names <https://fortune.com/2023/08/24/george-jones-care-bears-harry-potter-ivest-sale/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks> courtesy of the success of the eight Potter films released between 2001 and 2011, which made $7.7 billion in worldwide box-office earnings <https://screenrant.com/harry-potter-movies-box-office-profit-explained/>.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe <https://fortune.com/2024/06/17/daniel-radcliffe-child-star-net-worth-tony-award/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=suggested_search&utm_campaign=search_link_clicks>, who rose to fame playing "the boy who lived" at age 12, now has an estimated worth of $110 million <https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/daniel-radcliffe-net-worth/>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/09/10/harry-potter-casting-series-daniel-radcliffe-child-stars/\n\nSource 2:\nMillennials, prepare yourselves.

With over $25 billion made between books, movies, video games, and more, the boy wizard’s commercial franchise has far outshone and outlasted most pop-culture fads. \n\nFor Bloomsbury, the British publisher behind the series, it’s proven a massive cash cow, helping it become one of the world’s leading players. But it’s also been 27 years since the first J.K. Rowling–authored book was released (yes, it’s that old). \n\nSince then, genres have come and gone; e-books rose, fell, and then started rising again <https://wordsrated.com/ebooks-sales-statistics/>; and social media sites like TikTok upended the way many people discover books. Amid all these changes, Bloomsbury has been able to avoid becoming a one-wizard wonder, and its titles crowd bookstore windows to this day.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/30/book-publisher-bloomsbury-harry-potter-sarah-j-maas-record-sales-profits-fans-booktok/\n\nSource 1:\n“That shifts the emphasis on making money from her [Maas’s] back catalog, in the same way that Bloomsbury has managed to sweat its Harry Potter assets with new versions of the beloved book series,” AJ Bell’s investment director Russ Mould said. \n\n“The news is like a famous band saying they’re going on a hiatus—disappointment now, but the potential to make even more money when they return.”\n\nStill, Bloomsbury is confident it’ll rise above the tide. It’s set up a strong fan base with its core authors, who keep new and old readers coming, while leaving room to experiment with new and innovative ones. And with academic books in the mix, it has what CEO Newton calls a “resilient model” in the face of volatility that typifies creative industries.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/30/book-publisher-bloomsbury-harry-potter-sarah-j-maas-record-sales-profits-fans-booktok/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/30/book-publisher-bloomsbury-harry-potter-sarah-j-maas-record-sales-profits-fans-booktok/\n\nSource 1:\nAnd while peak Harry Potter mania may have long passed, its magic continues to draw Bloomsbury new business.
