Several themes echoed across resolutions as a whole, including better investment into AI, emphasizing employee wellbeing, and improving employee learning and skills development. \n\nCori Davis, the chief people officer at biotechnology company Genentech, took a big picture approach to her resolution, and noted that the last several years have been difficult for everyone.

Keep fund fees and taxes minimal, and that will have more of a positive effect long-term on their performance.\n\n“The long-run way to build wealth is to just keep on going,” he says.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/07/30/tech-stocks-wild-ride-makes-the-case-for-index-fund-investing-says-wall-street-guru-burt-malkiel/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/30/tech-stocks-wild-ride-makes-the-case-for-index-fund-investing-says-wall-street-guru-burt-malkiel/"}

The S&P 500 is up about 12% year-to-date and some of the biggest players in AI, like Nvidia and Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/>, have seen their shares continue to soar in 2024.\n\nCorrection, Jun. 11, 2024: This story has been updated with corrected figures for the number of new millionaires.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/08/ai-stock-boom-us-millionaires-600000-nvidia-meta-microsoft-sp500/\n\nSource 4:\n* Chicago Bears (From Carolina Panthers) \n * Washington Commanders \n * New England Patriots \n * Arizona Cardinals \n * Los Angeles Chargers \n * New York Giants \n * Tennessee Titans \n * Atlanta Falcons \n * Chicago Bears \n * New York Jets \n * Minnesota Vikings \n * Denver Broncos \n * Las Vegas Raiders \n * New Orleans Saints \n * Indianapolis Colts \n * Seattle Seahawks \n * Jacksonville Jaguars \n * Cincinnati Bengals \n * Los Angeles Rams \n * Pittsburgh Steelers \n * Miami Dolphins \n * Philadelphia Eagles \n * Minnesota Vikings \n * Dallas Cowboys \n * Green Bay Packers \n * Tampa Bay Buccaneers \n * Arizona Cardinals \n * Buffalo Bills \n * Detroit Lions \n * Baltimore Ravens \n * San Francisco 49ers \n * Kansas City Chiefs \nWhich players are first-round favorites in the 2024 NFL Draft?\n\nQuarterbacks should be in high demand this year. Caleb Williams from USC is expected to be scooped up first, but several other teams are looking for field generals as well. Other expected high-ranking picks could include:\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/watch-stream-nfl-draft-2024-live-online-free-without-cable-what-channel-abc-espn-nfl-network/\n\nSource 4:\n* Jayden Daniels, LSU – Daniels is a Heisman trophy winner and passed for 40 touchdowns last season. He’s expected to be one of the hottest picks in the draft. \n * Drake Maye, UNC – Maye could easily be the second pick of the year, though it’s neck-and-neck with Daniels. Don’t be surprised if the Vikings try to maneuver an early trade to nab him, as Josh McCown was Maye’s coach in high school. \n * Marvin Harrison Jr, Ohio State – Taking a quick break from the QB shuffle, Harrison is a wide receiver who likely won’t have to wait long to find a home in the NFL. He was widely considered the best receiver in college football last year. \n * J. McCarthy, Michigan – After leading the Wolverines to a national championship last year, McCarthy is certain to be an early pick. \nWhat comes after the draft?\n\nOnce the draft is over, the 2024-2025 schedule is next on the agenda. That will be released in May. The season will begin on Thursday, September 5, wrapping up with Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9.\n\nTickets will go on sale after the schedule is announced.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/watch-stream-nfl-draft-2024-live-online-free-without-cable-what-channel-abc-espn-nfl-network/\n\nSource 5:\nAnd that was before the stock market set fresh record highs over the past week as new inflation data <https://fortune.com/2024/07/11/inflation-consumer-price-index-drop-interest-rate-cuts/> gave the Federal Reserve more leeway to cut rates in the near future and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sounded increasingly dovish <https://fortune.com/2024/07/09/economic-outlook-fed-chair-jerome-powell-warns-inflation-risk/>.\n\nThe surge of interest in single stocks comes as stock-picking has been overshadowed by passive investing in recent years, with funds that track indexes like the S&P 500 drawing more and more capital while actively managed funds continue to underperform the market <https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/sp500-vs-actively-managed-funds-outperformance-buying-holding-passive-index-investing/>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/13/stock-market-investing-buying-single-record-pace-sp500-beating-bets-lowest-ever/\n\nSource 6:\nThis year, we will look to attract and retain talent by enabling a competency-based talent structure through our learning and development programs that will inform the organization's succession needs. We are also continuing to invest in areas like flexible work and digital assets that enable employee efficiency. And we will cultivate a culture of belonging by providing benefits that meet the needs of our team while recognizing our folks in meaningful ways.\n\nColleen McKeown, CHRO at Prologis, a real estate investment trust specializing in supply-chain logistics\n\nMy 2024 resolution is to work with our CTO and business leaders to build an AI-focused team with the necessary talent to help the company execute our AI strategy and road map. In addition to this, I will continue to focus on succession planning, including ensuring that all very senior roles have two identified successors and all successors have a development plan. Lastly, in 2024 I would like to leverage Prologis’ in-house version of ChatGPT to answer all emails and give me more time to think and plan!\n\nJacqui Canney, chief people officer at ServiceNow\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/01/08/hr-leaders-walmart-estee-lauder-new-years-resolutions-human-resources-management/\n\nSource 6:\nJacqui Canney, chief people officer at ServiceNow\n\nIn 2024, I, along with many other CHROs, am doubling down on prioritizing transformation, mental well-being, GenAI, skills, and DEI. Beyond sustaining the growth and progress we made in these areas in 2023, my New Year’s resolution is to help scale and evolve our business—and that requires a relentless focus on people and technology. \n\nMichael O'Hare, executive vice president of global human resources at Estée Lauder Companies\n\nAt the Estée Lauder Companies (ELC), we believe in the practice of leadership from every chair and encourage the concept of reverse mentorship, where senior leaders learn from emerging talent. In 2024, I’m personally committed to continue learning from the next generation of leaders at ELC and fostering our culture of high-performance leadership across all levels.\n\nElias Reyna, chief people and diversity officer at Papa Johns\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/01/08/hr-leaders-walmart-estee-lauder-new-years-resolutions-human-resources-management/\n\nSource 7:\nGood morning!\n\nLove them or hate them <https://fortune.com/well/2022/12/24/sheryl-lee-ralph-on-why-shes-ditching-new-years-resolutions-im-not-doing-it-anymore-im-just-gonna-be-my-best/>, New Year’s resolutions offer a chance for anyone to start the year with a clean slate and define their ambitions for the coming months. Business leaders are certainly no exception.\n\nI reached out to the CHROs from 10 companies, including Estée Lauder, Papa Johns, and Walmart, asking them to share their hopes for 2024, and what they plan to focus their energies on. \n\nTheir answers ran the gamut, from providing better support for middle managers, to concentrating on retaining talent. Several themes echoed across resolutions as a whole, including better investment into AI, emphasizing employee wellbeing, and improving employee learning and skills development. \n\nCori Davis, the chief people officer at biotechnology company Genentech, took a big picture approach to her resolution, and noted that the last several years have been difficult for everyone. Her goal is to “bring more joy and energy into the workplace.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/01/08/hr-leaders-new-years-resolutions-2024/\n\nSource 8:\nIn that regard, index funds are still king <https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/wall-street-burt-malkiel-biggest-investing-mistakes/>. And a broad-based fund solves the problem of picking sectors as well, because they give meaningful exposure to the sectors producing the best returns. \n\n“The beauty of owning a broad index is that you’re likely to get exposure to that AI winner in your portfolio anyway,” he writes.\n\nRather than trying to pick stocks, Malkiel encourages investors to focus on what they can control, including the cost of their investments. Keep fund fees and taxes minimal, and that will have more of a positive effect long-term on their performance.\n\n“The long-run way to build wealth is to just keep on going,” he says.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/07/30/tech-stocks-wild-ride-makes-the-case-for-index-fund-investing-says-wall-street-guru-burt-malkiel/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/30/tech-stocks-wild-ride-makes-the-case-for-index-fund-investing-says-wall-street-guru-burt-malkiel/"}

That being said, some experts have shared their views on the potential performance of certain stocks and sectors in 2024.

According to Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, the S&P 500 may see greater depth and diversity in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies beyond the "Magnificent Seven" (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) that dominated the index in 2023 [1]. Denier also anticipates that midcaps may outperform large-cap stocks in 2024 [1]. Additionally, the AI sector has been gaining attention, with Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla having surged significantly in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimating that AI investment could reach $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

However, rather than trying to pick specific stocks, Burt Malkiel, a Wall Street guru, recommends focusing on broad-based index funds, which can provide meaningful exposure to various sectors, including those producing the best returns [8]. He emphasizes the

That being said, some experts have shared their views on the potential performance of certain stocks and sectors in 2024.

According to Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, the S&P 500 may see greater depth and diversity in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies beyond the "Magnificent Seven" (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) that dominated the index in 2023 [1]. Denier also anticipates that midcaps may outperform large-cap stocks in 2024 [1]. Additionally, the AI sector has been gaining attention, with Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla having surged significantly in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimating that AI investment could reach $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

However, rather than trying to pick specific stocks, Burt Malkiel, a Wall Street guru, recommends focusing on broad-based index funds, which can provide meaningful exposure to various sectors, including those producing the best returns [8]. He emphasizes the importance of keeping fund fees and taxes minimal to have a positive effect on long-term performance [8]. As for specific stocks, it's essential to conduct thorough

According to Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, the S&P 500 may see greater depth and diversity in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies beyond the "Magnificent Seven" (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) that dominated the index in 2023 [1]. Denier also anticipates that midcaps may outperform large-cap stocks in 2024 [1]. Additionally, the AI sector has been gaining attention, with Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla having surged significantly in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimating that AI investment could reach $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

However, rather than trying to pick specific stocks, Burt Malkiel, a Wall Street guru, recommends focusing on broad-based index funds, which can provide meaningful exposure to various sectors, including those producing the best returns [8]. He emphasizes the importance of keeping fund fees and taxes minimal to have a positive effect on long-term performance [8].

2024-11-08 06:45:31,809: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: While I can provide some insights based on the sources, I must note that making specific stock picks can be challenging and subject to various market and economic factors. That being said, some experts have shared their views on the potential performance of certain stocks and sectors in 2024.

According to Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, the S&P 500 may see greater depth and diversity in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies beyond the "Magnificent Seven" (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) that dominated the index in 2023 [1]. Denier also anticipates that midcaps may outperform large-cap stocks in 2024 [1]. Additionally, the AI sector has been gaining attention, with Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla having surged significantly in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimating that AI investment could reach $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

However, rather than trying to pick specific stocks, Burt Malkiel, a Wall Street guru, recommends focusing on broad-based index funds, which can provide meaningful exposure to various sectors, including those producing the best returns [8]. He emphasizes the importance of keeping fund fees and taxes minimal to have a positive effect on long-term performance [8]. As for specific stocks, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consider multiple factors before making any investment decisions.

2024-11-08 06:45:31,964: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: While I can provide some insights based on the sources, I must note that making specific stock picks can be challenging and subject to various market and economic factors. That being said, some experts have shared their views on the potential performance of certain stocks and sectors in 2024.

According to Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, the S&P 500 may see greater depth and diversity in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies beyond the "Magnificent Seven" (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) that dominated the index in 2023 [1]. Denier also anticipates that midcaps may outperform large-cap stocks in 2024 [1]. Additionally, the AI sector has been gaining attention, with Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla having surged significantly in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimating that AI investment could reach $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

However, rather than trying to pick specific stocks, Burt Malkiel, a Wall Street guru, recommends focusing on broad-based index funds, which can provide meaningful exposure to various sectors, including those producing the best returns [8]. He emphasizes the importance of keeping fund fees and taxes minimal to have a positive effect on long-term performance [8]. As for specific stocks, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consider multiple factors before making any investment decisions.

2024-11-08 06:45:32,126: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: While I can provide some insights based on the sources, I must note that making specific stock picks can be challenging and subject to various market and economic factors. That being said, some experts have shared their views on the potential performance of certain stocks and sectors in 2024.

According to Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, the S&P 500 may see greater depth and diversity in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies beyond the "Magnificent Seven" (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) that dominated the index in 2023 [1]. Denier also anticipates that midcaps may outperform large-cap stocks in 2024 [1]. Additionally, the AI sector has been gaining attention, with Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla having surged significantly in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimating that AI investment could reach $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

However, rather than trying to pick specific stocks, Burt Malkiel, a Wall Street guru, recommends focusing on broad-based index funds, which can provide meaningful exposure to various sectors, including those producing the best returns [8]. He emphasizes the importance of keeping fund fees and taxes minimal to have a positive effect on long-term performance [8]. As for specific stocks, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consider multiple factors before making any investment decisions.

2024-11-08 06:45:32,231: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What are the best stock picks for 2024?

2024-11-08 06:45:32,231: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: While I can provide some insights based on the sources, I must note that making specific stock picks can be challenging and subject to various market and economic factors. That being said, some experts have shared their views on the potential performance of certain stocks and sectors in 2024.

According to Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, the S&P 500 may see greater depth and diversity in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies beyond the "Magnificent Seven" (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) that dominated the index in 2023 [1]. Denier also anticipates that midcaps may outperform large-cap stocks in 2024 [1]. Additionally, the AI sector has been gaining attention, with Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla having surged significantly in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimating that AI investment could reach $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

However, rather than trying to pick specific stocks, Burt Malkiel, a Wall Street guru, recommends focusing on broad-based index funds, which can provide meaningful exposure to various sectors, including those producing the best returns [8]. He emphasizes the importance of keeping fund fees and taxes minimal to have a positive effect on long-term performance [8]. As for specific stocks, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consider multiple factors before making any investment decisions.

In terms of specific stocks, some of the companies mentioned in the sources as having potential in 2024 include Nvidia, Meta, Tesla

That being said, some experts have shared their views on the potential performance of certain stocks and sectors in 2024.

According to Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, the S&P 500 may see greater depth and diversity in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies beyond the "Magnificent Seven" (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) that dominated the index in 2023 [1]. Denier also anticipates that midcaps may outperform large-cap stocks in 2024 [1]. Additionally, the AI sector has been gaining attention, with Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla having surged significantly in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimating that AI investment could reach $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

However, rather than trying to pick specific stocks, Burt Malkiel, a Wall Street guru, recommends focusing on broad-based index funds, which can provide meaningful exposure to various sectors, including those producing the best returns [8]. He emphasizes the importance of keeping fund fees and taxes minimal to have a positive effect on long-term performance [8].

That being said, some experts have shared their views on the potential performance of certain stocks and sectors in 2024.

According to Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, the S&P 500 may see greater depth and diversity in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies beyond the "Magnificent Seven" (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) that dominated the index in 2023 [1]. Denier also anticipates that midcaps may outperform large-cap stocks in 2024 [1]. Additionally, the AI sector has been gaining attention, with Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla having surged significantly in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimating that AI investment could reach $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

However, rather than trying to pick specific stocks, Burt Malkiel, a Wall Street guru, recommends focusing on broad-based index funds, which can provide meaningful exposure to various sectors, including those producing the best returns [8].

Additionally, the AI sector has been gaining attention, with Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla having surged significantly in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimating that AI investment could reach $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

He emphasizes the importance of keeping fund fees and taxes minimal to have a positive effect on long-term performance [8]. As for specific stocks, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consider multiple factors before making any investment decisions.

In terms of specific stocks, some of the companies mentioned in the sources as having potential in 2024 include Nvidia, Meta, Tesla, and Microsoft, which are all involved in the AI sector [3]. However, it's essential to

That being said, some experts have shared their views on the potential performance of certain stocks and sectors in 2024.

According to Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, the S&P 500 may see greater depth and diversity in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies beyond the "Magnificent Seven" (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) that dominated the index in 2023 [1]. Denier also anticipates that midcaps may outperform large-cap stocks in 2024 [1]. Additionally, the AI sector has been gaining attention, with Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla having surged significantly in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimating that AI investment could reach $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

He emphasizes the importance of keeping fund fees and taxes minimal to have a positive effect on long-term performance [8]. As for specific stocks, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consider multiple factors before making any investment decisions.

In terms of specific stocks, some of the companies mentioned in the sources as having potential in 2024 include Nvidia, Meta, Tesla, and Microsoft, which are all involved in the AI sector [3]. However, it's essential to remember that past performance is not

Additionally, the AI sector has been gaining attention, with Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla having surged significantly in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimating that AI investment could reach $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

However, rather than trying to pick specific stocks, Burt Malkiel, a Wall Street guru, recommends focusing on broad-based index funds, which can provide meaningful exposure to various sectors, including those producing the best returns [8]. He emphasizes the importance of keeping fund fees and taxes minimal to have a positive effect on long-term performance [8]. As for specific stocks, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consider multiple factors before making any investment decisions.

In terms of specific stocks, some of the companies mentioned in the sources as having potential in 2024 include Nvidia, Meta, Tesla, and Microsoft, which are all involved in the AI sector [3]. However, it's essential to remember that past performance is not a guarantee of future success, and individual stock picks should be made with caution and careful consideration

2024-11-08 06:45:33,144: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What are the best stock picks for 2024?

2024-11-08 06:45:33,144: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: While I can provide some insights based on the sources, I must note that making specific stock picks can be challenging and subject to various market and economic factors. That being said, some experts have shared their views on the potential performance of certain stocks and sectors in 2024.

According to Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, the S&P 500 may see greater depth and diversity in 2024, with more movement in the remaining 493 companies beyond the "Magnificent Seven" (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) that dominated the index in 2023 [1]. Denier also anticipates that midcaps may outperform large-cap stocks in 2024 [1]. Additionally, the AI sector has been gaining attention, with Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla having surged significantly in 2023, and Goldman Sachs estimating that AI investment could reach $200 billion globally by 2025 [3].

However, rather than trying to pick specific stocks, Burt Malkiel, a Wall Street guru, recommends focusing on broad-based index funds, which can provide meaningful exposure to various sectors, including those producing the best returns [8]. He emphasizes the importance of keeping fund fees and taxes minimal to have a positive effect on long-term performance [8]. As for specific stocks, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consider multiple factors before making any investment decisions.

In terms of specific stocks, some of the companies mentioned in the sources as having potential in 2024 include Nvidia, Meta, Tesla, and Microsoft, which are all involved in the AI sector [3]. However, it's essential to remember that past performance is not a guarantee of future success, and individual stock picks should be made with caution and careful consideration.
