My end goal is to be a CEO or president of a company or to be a successful business owner. I felt that the MBA would help me get there. Some people can get there without it.

It would\'ve been an in-person program <https://fortune.com/education/business/mba/rankings/best-mba-programs/> because the online master\'s experience you see today was just not what it was then.

In the email, he said he was surprised Google and OpenAI had designed data centers, sourced silicon chips, and built programming frameworks to enable all their work, according to the email.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/02/microsoft-ai-openai-google-bill-gates-satya-nadella-chatgpt-kevin-scott-email/\n\nSource 2:\n“When they took all of the infrastructure that they had built to build NLP [natural language processing] models that we couldn’t easily replicate, I started to take things more seriously,” Scott told Gates and Nadella. \n\nMicrosoft did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe advent of AI has put many of those resources in extremely high demand.

But for me, I have a certain set of career goals. I wanted to make it to the C-suite by the time I was 40. I\'m 38 now. My end goal is to be a CEO or president of a company or to be a successful business owner. I felt that the MBA would help me get there. Some people can get there without it. I take a look around at the current market as it is, and it just keeps getting more and more competitive. More and more people are getting their master\'s <https://fortune.com/education/business/articles/2022/04/21/nearly-9-in-10-graduates-say-an-mba-is-worth-it/>.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/education/articles/how-my-online-mba-helped-me-land-a-43-salary-increase-and-a-spot-in-the-c-suite/\n\nSource 3:\nFortune: How did you decide it was time to get your MBA?\n\nScott: And I had been kind of been going back and forth for about the past 15 years on whether I wanted to do my MBA or not. Having worked for universities in the past, I could have done it free of cost <https://fortune.com/education/business/articles/2021/09/01/how-to-get-your-employer-to-pay-for-your-executive-mba-degree/>. But when I worked in those environments, I was working in sports, which has a very crazy schedule where you\'re talking 60, 70 hours a week and constantly traveling, so not conducive to the type of time commitment that comes with a master\'s program. \n\nThen I considered it again in 2013 getting at the University of North Florida. It would\'ve been an in-person program <https://fortune.com/education/business/mba/rankings/best-mba-programs/> because the online master\'s experience you see today was just not what it was then. It just was not very robust or credible, to be honest with you. I had also become a new dad, and so just realized that that was still not a time commitment I could have made.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/education/articles/how-my-online-mba-helped-me-land-a-43-salary-increase-and-a-spot-in-the-c-suite/\n\nSource 4:\nAnthony Scaramucci is founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital and founder and chairman of SALT.
