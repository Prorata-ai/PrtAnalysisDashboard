"In using the collective \'we,\'" the editorial said, "the President told Hitler and Mussolini, far more impressively than he told Warm Springs, that the tremendous force of the U.S. must be a factor in their current thinking. He told the Axis powers that the Administration is far from indifferent to their plottings. He made it plain that a war forced by them would from the outset involve the destinies of a nation which, as they fully realize, is potentially far stronger than Germany and Italy united."

Patterson <https://fortune.com/company/patterson/> summarized Clay\'s performance: "It is my considered judgment that to him, more than to any other individual, should go the credit for the success of the armament effort in the war years." But for his place in history, no doubt, Clay will be chiefly remembered for his "decision in Germany." In the spring of 1945 he was named deputy to General Eisenhower, and soon thereafter became Military Governor of occupied Germany. For four years, without precedents to guide him, and often without clear directives from Washington, Clay carried on the task of maintaining the morale of restless U.S. troops, of ruling, punishing, and rehabilitating a conquered country, and most important, as it turned out, of conducting the cold war, at its hottest point, with the blustering Russians.

The 125,000 tons of coal "cobelligerent" Italy is now receiving a month amount to virtual cessation of industrial activities. Combined with the spiritual exhaustion that is the result of two decades of Fascism, this state of economic affairs makes for a national atmosphere of cynical nihilism. The dominant purpose of contemporary Italian life is getting food. Italians have two popular ways of improving their official ration. One is the black market, which has by now a far larger volume than the "normal" economy. It has been estimated that two-thirds of all market transactions throughout liberated Italy are "black." The other trick is to line up wherever G.I. chow is issued. Many an Italian lives on what U.S. soldiers leave on their plates.

Before their armies invaded Europe, everything had been figured out, except the actual course of events. That the Allies would have to arrive with civilian supplies, with food and raw materials, was generally understood. So the U.S. and Great Britain pooled the economic brain trusters of the two General Staffs to produce a minimum plan. Basing their calculations on years of research that had gone into the Allied Minimum Imports Program (a combined planning venture of all United Nations), the brain trusters of the General Staffs emerged with three hypotheses and three corresponding requirement plans. Plan A assumed the Germans would retire in a hurry and without scorching. Plan B assessed the supply requirements if the Germans were continually driven back, but had sufficient time to scorch. Plan C figured on very slow progress and complete destruction of painfully conquered territories. The military did what military would do. They first found out how much shipping space and how many supplies they thought they could do without, and then picked the plan that fitted this arithmetic.

For four years, without precedents to guide him, and often without clear directives from Washington, Clay carried on the task of maintaining the morale of restless U.S. troops, of ruling, punishing, and rehabilitating a conquered country, and most important, as it turned out, of conducting the cold war, at its hottest point, with the blustering Russians.

Before their armies invaded Europe, everything had been figured out, except the actual course of events. That the Allies would have to arrive with civilian supplies, with food and raw materials, was generally understood. So the U.S. and Great Britain pooled the economic brain trusters of the two General Staffs to produce a minimum plan. Basing their calculations on years of research that had gone into the Allied Minimum Imports Program (a combined planning venture of all United Nations), the brain trusters of the General Staffs emerged with three hypotheses and three corresponding requirement plans. Plan A assumed the Germans would retire in a hurry and without scorching. Plan B assessed the supply requirements if the Germans were continually driven back, but had sufficient time to scorch. Plan C figured on very slow progress and complete destruction of painfully conquered territories. The military did what military would do. They first found out how much shipping space and how many supplies they thought they could do without, and then picked the plan that fitted this arithmetic.

Before their armies invaded Europe, everything had been figured out, except the actual course of events. That the Allies would have to arrive with civilian supplies, with food and raw materials, was generally understood. So the U.S. and Great Britain pooled the economic brain trusters of the two General Staffs to produce a minimum plan. Basing their calculations on years of research that had gone into the Allied Minimum Imports Program (a combined planning venture of all United Nations), the brain trusters of the General Staffs emerged with three hypotheses and three corresponding requirement plans. Plan A assumed the Germans would retire in a hurry and without scorching. Plan B assessed the supply requirements if the Germans were continually driven back, but had sufficient time to scorch. Plan C figured on very slow progress and complete destruction of painfully conquered territories. The military did what military would do. They first found out how much shipping space and how many supplies they thought they could do without, and then picked the plan that fitted this arithmetic.

So the U.S. and Great Britain pooled the economic brain trusters of the two General Staffs to produce a minimum plan.

Plan C figured on very slow progress and complete destruction of painfully conquered territories. The military did what military would do.

Before their armies invaded Europe, everything had been figured out, except the actual course of events. That the Allies would have to arrive with civilian supplies, with food and raw materials, was generally understood. So the U.S. and Great Britain pooled the economic brain trusters of the two General Staffs to produce a minimum plan. Basing their calculations on years of research that had gone into the Allied Minimum Imports Program (a combined planning venture of all United Nations), the brain trusters of the General Staffs emerged with three hypotheses and three corresponding requirement plans. Plan A assumed the Germans would retire in a hurry and without scorching. Plan B assessed the supply requirements if the Germans were continually driven back, but had sufficient time to scorch. Plan C figured on very slow progress and complete destruction of painfully conquered territories. The military did what military would do. They first found out how much shipping space and how many supplies they thought they could do without, and then picked the plan that fitted this arithmetic. Sure enough, it was Plan A, with a few items of Plan B thrown in for good measure.

It estimates that inflation will fall even faster in the world’s wealthy countries, from 4.6% last year to 2.6% this year and 2% — the target range for most major central banks — in 2025.\n\nThe slowdown in inflation, after years of crushing price increases in the aftermath of the pandemic, led the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to cut interest rates this year after they had aggressively raised them to try to tame inflation.\n\n“The battle against inflation is almost won,″ Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF\'s chief economist, told reporters Tuesday. ”In most countries, inflation is hovering close to central bank targets.″\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/22/imf-forecast-inflation-drops-china-slow-economic-growth-recession-europe/\n\nSource 6:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/04/21/investor-warning-most-dangerous-time-wwii-us-election-donald-trump/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/21/investor-warning-most-dangerous-time-wwii-us-election-donald-trump/\n\nSource 7:\nWith tensions rising ahead of an uncertain election <https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/10/30/why-kamala-harriss-chances-of-victory-just-jumped>, it\'s easy to get wrapped up in predictions and worries.

And while the stock market’s performance in the 2020s hasn’t been as impressive as it was in the early 1950s, it definitely doesn’t look like the 1970s.

Geopolitical risk\n\nGeopolitical tensions were a major feature of the 1950s, just like they are today, as the staunchly capitalist U.S. sought the “global containment” of Communism after World War II, while the Soviet Union attempted to spread its own ideology. This war of economic and political systems manifested in ongoing tensions between the world’s superpowers and a persistent threat of nuclear war, and even helped spark the Korean War.\n\nIt was a time of “heightened geopolitical risk,” Allen noted, explaining that “this was in the early phase of the Cold War, when there were major tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and those tensions were evident in several regions.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-bracing-stagflation-economy-1950s-style-boom-instead/\n\nSource 10:\nNews that the U.S. is enthusiastically cranking up tariffs under both parties would have sounded otherworldly for most of the past 75 years. For the first portion of U.S. history, the bulk of the federal government’s revenue—in some years nearly 100%—came from tariffs. The country began to trim its reliance on tariffs after a 1913 constitutional amendment allowed income tax. Then, at the end of World War II, 28 countries banded together to negotiate agreements that would reduce tariffs and other trade barriers, reasoning that lowering these barriers to free trade would leave all the participating countries better off. That group’s successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO), today has 164 member countries, whose progress over the decades has been dramatic. In 1948, the U.S. collected duties that were 14% of the value of all tariffed imports and 6% of total imports. By 2017, the respective tariff rates had plunged to 5% and 1%.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/kamala-harris-donald-trump-tariffs-trade-inflation-us-election/'}

And beyond the Alps, the nature and the size of the job defy imagination: Germany, a more destructive force in her apocalyptic defeat than\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/europe-from-freedom-to-want/\n\nSource 4:\nitems of Plan B thrown in for good measure. Reality, as it happened, resembled much more a combination of Plan B and Plan C, which, in an ironical way, justified the selection of Plan A: the brilliant German "pocket" strategy of sealing all major Atlantic ports made the unloading of even the minimum civilian supplies technically impossible. And though the German scorching in western Europe and Italy differed from the Russian home version, Allied precision bombing, combined with the consequences of reckless Nazi withdrawal, disrupted the interior communications of the liberated countries just as effectively.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/europe-from-freedom-to-want/\n\nSource 4:\nTHE PLAN THAT FAILED\nThe Allied war chiefs knew that the liberation of Europe was bound to produce the most violent dislocation of history. Before their armies invaded Europe, everything had been figured out, except the actual course of events. That the Allies would have to arrive with civilian supplies, with food and raw materials, was generally understood. So the U.S. and Great Britain pooled the economic brain trusters of the two General Staffs to produce a minimum plan. Basing their calculations on years of research that had gone into the Allied Minimum Imports Program (a combined planning venture of all United Nations), the brain trusters of the General Staffs emerged with three hypotheses and three corresponding requirement plans. Plan A assumed the Germans would retire in a hurry and without scorching. Plan B assessed the supply requirements if the Germans were continually driven back, but had sufficient time to scorch. Plan C figured on very slow progress and complete destruction of painfully conquered territories. The military did what military would do. They first found out how much shipping space and how many supplies they thought they could do without, and then picked the plan that fitted this arithmetic. Sure enough, it was Plan A, with a few items of Plan B thrown in for good measure. Reality, as it happened, resembled much more a\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/europe-from-freedom-to-want/\n\nSource 5:\nThe global war against inflation has largely been won — and at surprisingly little cost to economic growth, the International Monetary Fund declared Tuesday.\n\nIn its latest assessment of the global economy, the IMF predicted that worldwide inflation will cool from 6.7% last year to 5.8% this year and to 4.3% in 2025. It estimates that inflation will fall even faster in the world’s wealthy countries, from 4.6% last year to 2.6% this year and 2% — the target range for most major central banks — in 2025.\n\nThe slowdown in inflation, after years of crushing price increases in the aftermath of the pandemic, led the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to cut interest rates this year after they had aggressively raised them to try to tame inflation.\n\n“The battle against inflation is almost won,″ Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF\'s chief economist, told reporters Tuesday. ”In most countries, inflation is hovering close to central bank targets.″\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/22/imf-forecast-inflation-drops-china-slow-economic-growth-recession-europe/\n\nSource 6:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/04/21/investor-warning-most-dangerous-time-wwii-us-election-donald-trump/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/04/21/investor-warning-most-dangerous-time-wwii-us-election-donald-trump/\n\nSource 7:\nWith tensions rising ahead of an uncertain election <https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/10/30/why-kamala-harriss-chances-of-victory-just-jumped>, it\'s easy to get wrapped up in predictions and worries.

And while the stock market’s performance in the 2020s hasn’t been as impressive as it was in the early 1950s, it definitely doesn’t look like the 1970s. Between January 1970 and the end of 1974, the S&P 500 sank 45%.\n\n4. Geopolitical risk\n\nGeopolitical tensions were a major feature of the 1950s, just like they are today, as the staunchly capitalist U.S. sought the “global containment” of Communism after World War II, while the Soviet Union attempted to spread its own ideology. This war of economic and political systems manifested in ongoing tensions between the world’s superpowers and a persistent threat of nuclear war, and even helped spark the Korean War.\n\nIt was a time of “heightened geopolitical risk,” Allen noted, explaining that “this was in the early phase of the Cold War, when there were major tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and those tensions were evident in several regions.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-bracing-stagflation-economy-1950s-style-boom-instead/\n\nSource 10:\nNews that the U.S. is enthusiastically cranking up tariffs under both parties would have sounded otherworldly for most of the past 75 years. For the first portion of U.S. history, the bulk of the federal government’s revenue—in some years nearly 100%—came from tariffs. The country began to trim its reliance on tariffs after a 1913 constitutional amendment allowed income tax. Then, at the end of World War II, 28 countries banded together to negotiate agreements that would reduce tariffs and other trade barriers, reasoning that lowering these barriers to free trade would leave all the participating countries better off. That group’s successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO), today has 164 member countries, whose progress over the decades has been dramatic. In 1948, the U.S. collected duties that were 14% of the value of all tariffed imports and 6% of total imports. By 2017, the respective tariff rates had plunged to 5% and 1%.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/kamala-harris-donald-trump-tariffs-trade-inflation-us-election/'}

2024-11-08 06:42:07,834: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: World War II ended in 1945. This is evident from Source 3, which mentions that General Clay was named deputy to General Eisenhower in the spring of 1945 and became Military Governor of occupied Germany [3]. Additionally, Source 4 mentions the liberation of Europe and the aftermath of the war, stating that the densely populated industrial areas of the North might be left in shambles, and beyond the Alps, the nature and the size of the job defy imagination: Germany, a more destructive force in her apocalyptic defeat than [4]. These sources suggest that the war had ended by 1945, and the focus had shifted to rebuilding and occupying the defeated nations.

It's worth noting that while the exact date of the end of World War II is not specified in the sources, it is widely known that the war in Europe ended on May 8, 1945, with the formal surrender of Germany, and the war in the Pacific ended on September 2, 1945, with the formal surrender of Japan. However, based on the information provided in the sources, we can confirm that the war ended in 1945 [3, 4].

The aftermath of World War II had a significant impact on the global economy and politics, as evident from the sources. Source 5 mentions that the global war against inflation has largely been won, and the International Monetary Fund predicted that worldwide inflation will cool from 6.7% last year to 5.8% this year

Additionally, Source 4 mentions the liberation of Europe and the aftermath of the war, stating that the densely populated industrial areas of the North might be left in shambles, and beyond the Alps, the nature and the size of the job defy imagination: Germany, a more destructive force in her apocalyptic defeat than [4]. These sources suggest that the war had ended by 1945, and the focus had shifted to rebuilding and occupying the defeated nations.

It's worth noting that while the exact date of the end of World War II is not specified in the sources, it is widely known that the war in Europe ended on May 8, 1945, with the formal surrender of Germany, and the war in the Pacific ended on September 2, 1945, with the formal surrender of Japan. However, based on the information provided in the sources, we can confirm that the war ended in 1945 [3, 4].

The aftermath of World War II had a significant impact on the global economy and politics, as evident from the sources. Source 5 mentions that the global war against inflation has largely been won, and the International Monetary Fund predicted that worldwide inflation will cool from 6.7% last year to 5.8% this year and to 4.3% in 2025 [5]. This suggests that the global economy has undergone significant changes since the end of World War II, and the focus has shifted to managing inflation and promoting economic growth.

2024-11-08 06:42:08,512: ObserveEventsHandler(  206): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd last message: In which year did World War II end?

2024-11-08 06:42:08,512: ObserveEventsHandler(  207): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd response: assistant: World War II ended in 1945. This is evident from Source 3, which mentions that General Clay was named deputy to General Eisenhower in the spring of 1945 and became Military Governor of occupied Germany [3]. Additionally, Source 4 mentions the liberation of Europe and the aftermath of the war, stating that the densely populated industrial areas of the North might be left in shambles, and beyond the Alps, the nature and the size of the job defy imagination: Germany, a more destructive force in her apocalyptic defeat than [4]. These sources suggest that the war had ended by 1945, and the focus had shifted to rebuilding and occupying the defeated nations.

It's worth noting that while the exact date of the end of World War II is not specified in the sources, it is widely known that the war in Europe ended on May 8, 1945, with the formal surrender of Germany, and the war in the Pacific ended on September 2, 1945, with the formal surrender of Japan. However, based on the information provided in the sources, we can confirm that the war ended in 1945 [3, 4].

The aftermath of World War II had a significant impact on the global economy and politics, as evident from the sources. Source 5 mentions that the global war against inflation has largely been won, and the International Monetary Fund predicted that worldwide inflation will cool from 6.7% last year to 5.8% this year and to 4.3% in 2025 [5]. This suggests that the global economy has undergone significant changes since the end of World War II, and the focus has shifted to managing inflation and promoting economic growth.
