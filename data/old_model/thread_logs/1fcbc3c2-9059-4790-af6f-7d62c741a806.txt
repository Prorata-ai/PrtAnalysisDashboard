Juneteenth, which was made a federal holiday in 2021, actually celebrates the best decision America ever made, which was to free enslaved people on American soil. America as we know it today would simply not exist without that decision.\n\nThe decision to end slavery ultimately had the profound impact of making America the strongest country in the world, socially and economically. From a social perspective, participating in an institution such as slavery, which is immoral, coldblooded, and brutal, destroys the humanity of both those who enslave and the enslaved.

From a social perspective, participating in an institution such as slavery, which is immoral, coldblooded, and brutal, destroys the humanity of both those who enslave and the enslaved. By shedding ourselves of this monstrosity, America paved the way for its core values to guide us to become the greatest country in the world. Our core values that all people are created equal, with the unalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, have become more of a reality. This decision provided the credibility for America to become a role model for democracy for the rest of the world.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.6210891), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='2cb3e269-9f8e-4c95-bd64-6295eb576ae5', embedding=None, metadata={'id': 'ebb1d872f6dac9e9ed03ea0ef13eb023e4dc4d5ce4ac416a247af26f8b6d1ad4-1', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': 'ebb1d872f6dac9e9ed03ea0ef13eb023e4dc4d5ce4ac416a247af26f8b6d1ad4', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 20240619, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-08', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kevin-Cohee-Martin-and-Malcolm.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 2024, 'date_month': 6, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/2024/06/19/oneunited-bank-ceo-ending-slavery-economic-decision-america-juneteenth/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 19, 'title': 'OneUnited Bank CEO: Ending slavery is the best economic decision America ever made', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/2024/06/19/oneunited-bank-ceo-ending-slavery-economic-decision-america-juneteenth/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='From an economic perspective, the decision to move away from an economic model that had slavery as its backbone was a brilliant decision.

Juneteenth, which was made a federal holiday in 2021, actually celebrates the best decision America ever made, which was to free enslaved people on American soil. America as we know it today would simply not exist without that decision.\n\nThe decision to end slavery ultimately had the profound impact of making America the strongest country in the world, socially and economically. From a social perspective, participating in an institution such as slavery, which is immoral, coldblooded, and brutal, destroys the humanity of both those who enslave and the enslaved. By shedding ourselves of this monstrosity, America paved the way for its core values to guide us to become the greatest country in the world. Our core values that all people are created equal, with the unalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, have become more of a reality. This decision provided the credibility for America to become a role model for democracy for the rest of the world.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/19/oneunited-bank-ceo-ending-slavery-economic-decision-america-juneteenth/\n\nSource 3:\nFrom an economic perspective, the decision to move away from an economic model that had slavery as its backbone was a brilliant decision. The economic dividends continue to reverberate through our economy to this day and into the future. Research suggests that the emancipation of enslaved people had a significant positive impact on the long-term economic growth of the United States. It is estimated that emancipation generated economic gains equivalent to up to 35% <https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insight/research-summary/one-giant-leap-emancipation-and-aggregate-economic-gains/> of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), making it one of the most important economic events in American history.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/19/oneunited-bank-ceo-ending-slavery-economic-decision-america-juneteenth/\n\nSource 4:\nFor example, when we started out, we were ruled by the British Empire—and it was taking advantage of us. What if Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson had sat around grumbling over a beer and didn’t do anything about it? During the Spanish-American War, Teddy Roosevelt formed his own regiment, traveled to Cuba, and fought. He did something. During WWII, the country and the world at large faced the enormous threat of Adolf Hitler. But then, unlike now, the sons and daughters of our leaders actually went to war and put themselves at great risk. Joseph P Kennedy had a son named John Kennedy, and John Kennedy went to war. Joe Kennedy’s eldest son was killed in that war. FDR’s son went to war. They did something.\n\nThe heroic part of our country is that, since its inception, the people got involved and took action. We didn’t sit around and just complain about Hitler—we took him out. Thoughts don’t mean much—it’s what you do that counts.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/presidential-candidates-biden-trump-debate-politics-leadership/\n\nSource 5:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/11/01/how-to-renounce-u-s-american-citizenship/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/11/01/how-to-renounce-u-s-american-citizenship/\n\nSource 6:\n“You can see this in the availability and relatively low cost of capital in the U.S. relative to other areas, even with the U.S.’ high government debt burden,” he said.\n\nEnergy independence\n\nThe U.S. is also far less reliant on energy imports than other developed nations.

Gibbs\' was the wily and irascible mind behind the SS United States, one of America\'s greatest engineering feats in league with the space shuttle, the Hoover dam and the interstate highway system. Like Ahab and Aeneas, Gibbs pursued his unlikely dreams across the oceans. Unlike them, he was successful and, more importantly, had lots of fun doing it. By Richard Austin Smith Even before the heroine showed up, it was plain that this was a decidedly offbeat love affair. The time was six o\'clock of a bald-headed May morning and the scene all wrong for a conventional romance. Manhattan was rising, coldly prismatic, out of the harbor mists. Brooklyn was already wide awake and on the way to work, a vehicular cataract that ran in a sort of growling sibilance along the smooth bed of the Narrows expressway. A few white guns wheeled above the oily chop of the Narrows itself, and on the far shore the whole of Staten Island seemed to be spilling down like a vast overstuffed warehouse into the waiting ships. As for the hero, the big\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-love-affair-of-william-francis-gibbs-fortune-1957/\n\nSource 7:\nlitheness of a yacht. Her running lights still burned from bridge and masthead, while halfway up her raking black bow was the mark of seas parted at thirty knots in another unrivaled crossing of the Western Ocean. "I know her fairly well by sight," the old man remarked, his mouth resolutely turned down and the light in his taciturn brown eyes giving no indication that this ship was the embodiment of thirty years of dreaming. Nor was there a hint that every morning of her passage east or west across the Atlantic he telephoned her captain and chief engineer to learn how she was doing, that only twice in nearly five years, and then only because a doctor kept him in bed, had he missed seeing her sail into New York Harbor and out again. The face that launched 6,000 ships The love affair between William Francis Gibbs and the liner United States had its origin in some very unsentimental cogitation by a third party, in this instance the United States Lines. The U.S.L.’s President John M. Franklin had come to the conclusion that only the best naval architect in the country could design what would be preeminently the best ship afloat; superiority was what he was after and superiority was what he got.

Amid the wreckage and the grief, the government and key institutions in the U.S., including corporations, need to start coming to grips with the ways the country has been changed by history\'s most successful and audacious terrorist attack. Because much has changed. History will likely regard the 12 years between Nov. 9, 1989--the day the Berlin Wall collapsed, foreshadowing the demise of the Soviet Union--and Sept. 11, 2001, as an era of American frivolity and self-absorption. An era when many people in the U.S. decided the outside world, the world beyond our borders, no longer mattered--certainly not in a life-and-death sense, as when an "evil empire" threatened nuclear destruction. It was the economy, stupid. Those dozen years were, in truth, something of a silly season, and the silly season is over. Sept. 11, 2001, ended it. George W. Bush now presides over a country about to fight a highly unusual war. Just how daunting and different this war will be is evident from a simple fact: As this article is written, there is talk in Washington of a declaration of war against an enemy...that has\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/battered-but-unbroken-fortune-classics-2001/'}

Juneteenth, which was made a federal holiday in 2021, actually celebrates the best decision America ever made, which was to free enslaved people on American soil. America as we know it today would simply not exist without that decision.\n\nThe decision to end slavery ultimately had the profound impact of making America the strongest country in the world, socially and economically. From a social perspective, participating in an institution such as slavery, which is immoral, coldblooded, and brutal, destroys the humanity of both those who enslave and the enslaved. By shedding ourselves of this monstrosity, America paved the way for its core values to guide us to become the greatest country in the world. Our core values that all people are created equal, with the unalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, have become more of a reality. This decision provided the credibility for America to become a role model for democracy for the rest of the world.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/19/oneunited-bank-ceo-ending-slavery-economic-decision-america-juneteenth/\n\nSource 3:\nFrom an economic perspective, the decision to move away from an economic model that had slavery as its backbone was a brilliant decision. The economic dividends continue to reverberate through our economy to this day and into the future. Research suggests that the emancipation of enslaved people had a significant positive impact on the long-term economic growth of the United States. It is estimated that emancipation generated economic gains equivalent to up to 35% <https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insight/research-summary/one-giant-leap-emancipation-and-aggregate-economic-gains/> of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), making it one of the most important economic events in American history.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/19/oneunited-bank-ceo-ending-slavery-economic-decision-america-juneteenth/\n\nSource 4:\nFor example, when we started out, we were ruled by the British Empire—and it was taking advantage of us. What if Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson had sat around grumbling over a beer and didn’t do anything about it? During the Spanish-American War, Teddy Roosevelt formed his own regiment, traveled to Cuba, and fought. He did something. During WWII, the country and the world at large faced the enormous threat of Adolf Hitler. But then, unlike now, the sons and daughters of our leaders actually went to war and put themselves at great risk. Joseph P Kennedy had a son named John Kennedy, and John Kennedy went to war. Joe Kennedy’s eldest son was killed in that war. FDR’s son went to war. They did something.\n\nThe heroic part of our country is that, since its inception, the people got involved and took action.

Juneteenth, which was made a federal holiday in 2021, actually celebrates the best decision America ever made, which was to free enslaved people on American soil. America as we know it today would simply not exist without that decision.\n\nThe decision to end slavery ultimately had the profound impact of making America the strongest country in the world, socially and economically. From a social perspective, participating in an institution such as slavery, which is immoral, coldblooded, and brutal, destroys the humanity of both those who enslave and the enslaved. By shedding ourselves of this monstrosity, America paved the way for its core values to guide us to become the greatest country in the world. Our core values that all people are created equal, with the unalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, have become more of a reality. This decision provided the credibility for America to become a role model for democracy for the rest of the world.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/19/oneunited-bank-ceo-ending-slavery-economic-decision-america-juneteenth/\n\nSource 3:\nFrom an economic perspective, the decision to move away from an economic model that had slavery as its backbone was a brilliant decision. The economic dividends continue to reverberate through our economy to this day and into the future. Research suggests that the emancipation of enslaved people had a significant positive impact on the long-term economic growth of the United States. It is estimated that emancipation generated economic gains equivalent to up to 35% <https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insight/research-summary/one-giant-leap-emancipation-and-aggregate-economic-gains/> of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), making it one of the most important economic events in American history.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/19/oneunited-bank-ceo-ending-slavery-economic-decision-america-juneteenth/\n\nSource 4:\nFor example, when we started out, we were ruled by the British Empire—and it was taking advantage of us. What if Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson had sat around grumbling over a beer and didn’t do anything about it? During the Spanish-American War, Teddy Roosevelt formed his own regiment, traveled to Cuba, and fought. He did something. During WWII, the country and the world at large faced the enormous threat of Adolf Hitler. But then, unlike now, the sons and daughters of our leaders actually went to war and put themselves at great risk. Joseph P Kennedy had a son named John Kennedy, and John Kennedy went to war. Joe Kennedy’s eldest son was killed in that war. FDR’s son went to war. They did something.\n\nThe heroic part of our country is that, since its inception, the people got involved and took action. We didn’t sit around and just complain about Hitler—we took him out. Thoughts don’t mean much—it’s what you do that counts.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/presidential-candidates-biden-trump-debate-politics-leadership/\n\nSource 5:\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/11/01/how-to-renounce-u-s-american-citizenship/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/11/01/how-to-renounce-u-s-american-citizenship/\n\nSource 6:\n“You can see this in the availability and relatively low cost of capital in the U.S. relative to other areas, even with the U.S.’ high government debt burden,” he said.\n\nEnergy independence\n\nThe U.S. is also far less reliant on energy imports than other developed nations.

Gibbs\' was the wily and irascible mind behind the SS United States, one of America\'s greatest engineering feats in league with the space shuttle, the Hoover dam and the interstate highway system. Like Ahab and Aeneas, Gibbs pursued his unlikely dreams across the oceans. Unlike them, he was successful and, more importantly, had lots of fun doing it. By Richard Austin Smith Even before the heroine showed up, it was plain that this was a decidedly offbeat love affair. The time was six o\'clock of a bald-headed May morning and the scene all wrong for a conventional romance. Manhattan was rising, coldly prismatic, out of the harbor mists. Brooklyn was already wide awake and on the way to work, a vehicular cataract that ran in a sort of growling sibilance along the smooth bed of the Narrows expressway. A few white guns wheeled above the oily chop of the Narrows itself, and on the far shore the whole of Staten Island seemed to be spilling down like a vast overstuffed warehouse into the waiting ships. As for the hero, the big\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-love-affair-of-william-francis-gibbs-fortune-1957/\n\nSource 7:\nlitheness of a yacht. Her running lights still burned from bridge and masthead, while halfway up her raking black bow was the mark of seas parted at thirty knots in another unrivaled crossing of the Western Ocean. "I know her fairly well by sight," the old man remarked, his mouth resolutely turned down and the light in his taciturn brown eyes giving no indication that this ship was the embodiment of thirty years of dreaming. Nor was there a hint that every morning of her passage east or west across the Atlantic he telephoned her captain and chief engineer to learn how she was doing, that only twice in nearly five years, and then only because a doctor kept him in bed, had he missed seeing her sail into New York Harbor and out again. The face that launched 6,000 ships The love affair between William Francis Gibbs and the liner United States had its origin in some very unsentimental cogitation by a third party, in this instance the United States Lines. The U.S.L.’s President John M. Franklin had come to the conclusion that only the best naval architect in the country could design what would be preeminently the best ship afloat; superiority was what he was after and superiority was what he got.

Amid the wreckage and the grief, the government and key institutions in the U.S., including corporations, need to start coming to grips with the ways the country has been changed by history\'s most successful and audacious terrorist attack. Because much has changed. History will likely regard the 12 years between Nov. 9, 1989--the day the Berlin Wall collapsed, foreshadowing the demise of the Soviet Union--and Sept. 11, 2001, as an era of American frivolity and self-absorption. An era when many people in the U.S. decided the outside world, the world beyond our borders, no longer mattered--certainly not in a life-and-death sense, as when an "evil empire" threatened nuclear destruction. It was the economy, stupid. Those dozen years were, in truth, something of a silly season, and the silly season is over. Sept. 11, 2001, ended it. George W. Bush now presides over a country about to fight a highly unusual war. Just how daunting and different this war will be is evident from a simple fact: As this article is written, there is talk in Washington of a declaration of war against an enemy...that has\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/battered-but-unbroken-fortune-classics-2001/'}
