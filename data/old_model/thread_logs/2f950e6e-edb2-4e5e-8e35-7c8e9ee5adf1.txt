This information is supported by multiple sources, including Source 5, which mentions Musk's split attention between Tesla and other companies, and Source 8, which quotes Musk's email to employees regarding layoffs.

It's worth noting that there have been some criticisms of Musk's leadership style and his ability to focus on Tesla's core business. For example, Source 3 mentions that Musk is "chasing shiny new objects" and not focused enough on Tesla, while Source 6 notes that some Tesla loyalists are beginning to question his leadership.

Despite these criticisms, Musk remains the CEO of Tesla as of 2023. His leadership has been a key factor in the company's growth and success, and he has a significant amount of control over the company's direction and strategy. [5] [8] [3] [6]
