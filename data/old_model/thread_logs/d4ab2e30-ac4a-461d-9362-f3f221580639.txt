AI luminaries including former Google Brain founder Andrew Ng, Stanford professor Fei-Fei Li and Meta chief scientist Yann LeCun have also come out against it, saying the bill is anything but simple or narrow. Instead, opponents insist the bill’s language is too vague. They say that the bill's focus on the AI models themselves, rather than how they are used, has led to uncertainty about compliance and left developers fearful of being legally liable for how models are deployed or modified by customers. They also maintain that the bill could consolidate power over AI in the hands of a few deep-pocketed tech behemoths, stifle the efforts of small startups and open source developers, and let China take the lead in AI development. \n\n“There are sensible proposals for AI regulations,” Ng told Fortune. “Unfortunately SB-1047 is not one of them.”", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.5769279), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='112d6d19-e03c-4a6e-9ec9-6b8aef84e7eb', embedding=None, metadata={'id': '46ce93b14b8f41f238f679ebf7e7d44c33518b750d8637fa2c361eca9235afd7-30', 'index': 'publishers_index-fortune10k_20241106', 'documentId': '46ce93b14b8f41f238f679ebf7e7d44c33518b750d8637fa2c361eca9235afd7', 'publisherId': '8f7b5db2-9f3a-4e1c-b8d6-7c3f2a0e9b1d', 'date': 19340801, 'ingestDate': '2024-11-08', 'image': 'https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fortune-logo-1600x900-white.jpg?w=2048', 'date_year': 1934, 'date_month': 8, 'url2': 'https://fortune.com/article/the-new-yorker/', 'domain': 'fortune.com', 'date_day': 1, 'title': 'The New Yorker', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/article/the-new-yorker/', 'contentType': 'web', 'metadataVersion': 1}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='as the whimsical biography that he wrote for his publishers.

He called a meeting with the managing directors of each bank business line, including Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth Management. The ensuing sessions resulted in hundreds of possible applications.\n\nWhat they ended up with is a hub and spoke system, per Vince’s orders, where Eliza herself is at the center, and engineers at each business line, representing the spokes, customize aspects of her software for their team.

This week, though, the Fed may change the statement it issues after each meeting in ways that could hint that a rate cut is coming soon.\n\nFor example, the statement it released after its June meeting had read, “In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the (Fed\'s) 2% inflation objective.” When it issues its new statement on Wednesday, the Fed could drop “modest” or alter it in some other way to underscore that additional progress on inflation has been achieved.\n\nIn June, the Fed\'s policymakers had forecast that year-over-year inflation would average 2.8% in the final three months of this year. On Friday, the government said <https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-election-federal-reserve-rates-economy-d8d44ca753aace952831a8f0cb42b97c> that inflation has already fallen below that level, to 2.5% in June, according to the Fed\'s preferred measure.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/fed-officials-expected-cut-rates-once-2024-market-betting-3-cuts-this-year/\n\nSource 7:\nIn a recent tweet <https://twitter.com/garrytan/status/1810694516221087784>, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan took a dismissive swipe at EA.

AI luminaries including former Google Brain founder Andrew Ng, Stanford professor Fei-Fei Li and Meta chief scientist Yann LeCun have also come out against it, saying the bill is anything but simple or narrow. Instead, opponents insist the bill’s language is too vague. They say that the bill\'s focus on the AI models themselves, rather than how they are used, has led to uncertainty about compliance and left developers fearful of being legally liable for how models are deployed or modified by customers. They also maintain that the bill could consolidate power over AI in the hands of a few deep-pocketed tech behemoths, stifle the efforts of small startups and open source developers, and let China take the lead in AI development. \n\n“There are sensible proposals for AI regulations,” Ng told Fortune. “Unfortunately SB-1047 is not one of them.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/15/california-ai-bill-sb-1047-fierce-debate-regulation-safety/\n\nSource 8:\nas the whimsical biography that he wrote for his publishers. As typical—and because it is true—it is reprinted at the loot of this column.* Characteristically, White omitted from his biography the fact that as editor of the Cornell Daily Sun he won the Associated Press prize for best undergraduate editorial of the year (it was on the use of correct English) and was the subject of a eulogy by Arthur Brisbane. Because the first President of Cornell was named Andrew D. While. Elwyn Brooks there acquired the nickname Andy. His intimates still use it. Also missing from his blurb is the fact that he was a successful advertising-copy writer, that he sometimes dreams of expressing himself as clearly in speech as in print, and that the most romantic episode in his career was probably his sudden marriage in 1929—an office surprise—to Kath-arine Sergeant Angell, then literary editor of The New Yorker. In her own right she will be discussed. The record of E. B. (Andy) White\'s absorptions is written for all to see in "Notes and Comment"—first his Scottish terriers, then his guppies, more recently a serious interest in economics—his crusade is against the complexity of life—and a continuation of his long campaign against war.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/the-new-yorker/\n\nSource 9:\nA hub and spoke model for AI\n\nThe genesis of Eliza goes back to the summer of 2023 when Robin Vince, CEO of BNY, called Pattanaik into his corner office on the bank’s executive floor. Vince wanted to address the problems the bank was experiencing as a result of having disparate AI projects being undertaken in offices around the world—resulting in development times as long as 18 months.\n\nVince told Pattanaik to fold the projects into a single centrally controlled AI platform. In addition to being more efficient, Pattanaik hoped he could make it more resilient against employees who might accidentally leak the bank’s secret sauce or client data. He called a meeting with the managing directors of each bank business line, including Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth Management. The ensuing sessions resulted in hundreds of possible applications.\n\nWhat they ended up with is a hub and spoke system, per Vince’s orders, where Eliza herself is at the center, and engineers at each business line, representing the spokes, customize aspects of her software for their team. The thousands of employees who have passed a two-hour session on how to safely handle data and interpret and double-check the responses can build their own agents.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/15/exclusive-how-bnys-new-ai-tool-eliza-is-minting-an-army-of-disposable-assistants-that-could-save-billions-in-labor-costs/'}

On Friday, the government said <https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-election-federal-reserve-rates-economy-d8d44ca753aace952831a8f0cb42b97c> that inflation has already fallen below that level, to 2.5% in June, according to the Fed\'s preferred measure.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/fed-officials-expected-cut-rates-once-2024-market-betting-3-cuts-this-year/\n\nSource 7:\nIn a recent tweet <https://twitter.com/garrytan/status/1810694516221087784>, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan took a dismissive swipe at EA.

Vince wanted to address the problems the bank was experiencing as a result of having disparate AI projects being undertaken in offices around the world—resulting in development times as long as 18 months.\n\nVince told Pattanaik to fold the projects into a single centrally controlled AI platform. In addition to being more efficient, Pattanaik hoped he could make it more resilient against employees who might accidentally leak the bank’s secret sauce or client data. He called a meeting with the managing directors of each bank business line, including Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth Management. The ensuing sessions resulted in hundreds of possible applications.\n\nWhat they ended up with is a hub and spoke system, per Vince’s orders, where Eliza herself is at the center, and engineers at each business line, representing the spokes, customize aspects of her software for their team.

This week, though, the Fed may change the statement it issues after each meeting in ways that could hint that a rate cut is coming soon.\n\nFor example, the statement it released after its June meeting had read, “In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the (Fed\'s) 2% inflation objective.” When it issues its new statement on Wednesday, the Fed could drop “modest” or alter it in some other way to underscore that additional progress on inflation has been achieved.\n\nIn June, the Fed\'s policymakers had forecast that year-over-year inflation would average 2.8% in the final three months of this year. On Friday, the government said <https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-election-federal-reserve-rates-economy-d8d44ca753aace952831a8f0cb42b97c> that inflation has already fallen below that level, to 2.5% in June, according to the Fed\'s preferred measure.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/29/fed-officials-expected-cut-rates-once-2024-market-betting-3-cuts-this-year/\n\nSource 7:\nIn a recent tweet <https://twitter.com/garrytan/status/1810694516221087784>, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan took a dismissive swipe at EA.

AI luminaries including former Google Brain founder Andrew Ng, Stanford professor Fei-Fei Li and Meta chief scientist Yann LeCun have also come out against it, saying the bill is anything but simple or narrow. Instead, opponents insist the bill’s language is too vague. They say that the bill\'s focus on the AI models themselves, rather than how they are used, has led to uncertainty about compliance and left developers fearful of being legally liable for how models are deployed or modified by customers. They also maintain that the bill could consolidate power over AI in the hands of a few deep-pocketed tech behemoths, stifle the efforts of small startups and open source developers, and let China take the lead in AI development. \n\n“There are sensible proposals for AI regulations,” Ng told Fortune. “Unfortunately SB-1047 is not one of them.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/15/california-ai-bill-sb-1047-fierce-debate-regulation-safety/\n\nSource 8:\nas the whimsical biography that he wrote for his publishers.

Also missing from his blurb is the fact that he was a successful advertising-copy writer, that he sometimes dreams of expressing himself as clearly in speech as in print, and that the most romantic episode in his career was probably his sudden marriage in 1929—an office surprise—to Kath-arine Sergeant Angell, then literary editor of The New Yorker. In her own right she will be discussed. The record of E. B.

Vince wanted to address the problems the bank was experiencing as a result of having disparate AI projects being undertaken in offices around the world—resulting in development times as long as 18 months.\n\nVince told Pattanaik to fold the projects into a single centrally controlled AI platform. In addition to being more efficient, Pattanaik hoped he could make it more resilient against employees who might accidentally leak the bank’s secret sauce or client data. He called a meeting with the managing directors of each bank business line, including Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth Management. The ensuing sessions resulted in hundreds of possible applications.\n\nWhat they ended up with is a hub and spoke system, per Vince’s orders, where Eliza herself is at the center, and engineers at each business line, representing the spokes, customize aspects of her software for their team. The thousands of employees who have passed a two-hour session on how to safely handle data and interpret and double-check the responses can build their own agents.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/15/exclusive-how-bnys-new-ai-tool-eliza-is-minting-an-army-of-disposable-assistants-that-could-save-billions-in-labor-costs/'}
