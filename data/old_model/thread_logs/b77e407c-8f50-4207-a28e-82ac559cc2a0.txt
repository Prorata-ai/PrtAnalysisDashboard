"Can we have a quick catch-up in the kitchen?" was suddenly replaced with a simple "Zoom?"\n\nBut now, the $19 billion video-calling giant no longer wants to be known for the very thing that made it famous. \n\nZoom is “so much more than just video meetings,” Graeme Geddes, Zoom’s chief growth officer, told Fortune. “Video is our heritage—so we\'re going to continue to lean in there, push the market, there\'s a lot of innovation that we\'re doing—but we\'re so much more than that.”\n\nSo what does the company primarily known for enabling remote workers to connect through a screen want to be known as going forward? \n\n“We want to be known as an AI-first collaboration platform,” Geddes responded.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/\n\nSource 1:\n“There was probably a little bit of overexcitement in terms of the stock, with people anticipating that the growth was going to be like that indefinitely, and then with the increased competition, I think that growth or maintaining all those users was difficult for them to do,” Barrett explains.\n\nIn addition to return-to-office mandates resulting in fewer people requiring Zoom’s services on a day-to-day basis, workers now have more platforms than ever to choose from. \n\nIt’s why, she says, Zoom has to highlight that it offers more than just video-calling services.\n\n“There\'s so many other players in the market that are offering these new features that have already bundled things together or that are constantly unveiling new features with generative AI. If it\'s not the legacy players like Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> or Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/> or Cisco, there\'s so many startups that are focused on pretty much every little niche imaginable with generative AI," Barrett says. "So you have to stay up to date. Otherwise your product just isn\'t going to be as useful."\n\nZoom\'s next act: Don\'t attend video meetings at all\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/\n\nSource 1:\n“A month ago, I was in Sydney—I\'m based in California, so definitely a couple of time zones away—and when you travel the one thing that doesn\'t stop is all the meetings that I\'m supposed to be in,” he shared.\n\nInstead of coworkers canceling calls until his return, business continued as usual—just without his presence. Thanks to the platform’s smart summary, Geddes boasted that he was able to wake up in the morning and act on whatever was discussed in his absence.\n\n“I was empowered; I didn\'t attend the meeting. Had a good idea of what was discussed,” he added. “Now, how much time would I have lost if I waited two weeks to get back and the teams were waiting for me to make that decision?”\n\n“So that leads to the conversation about: If I can get a summary, is there an option for my virtual assistant to show up on my behalf? So this is a natural evolution that we\'ll see of the platform of how we can deliver more value to our customers.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/\n\nSource 1:\nZoom\'s next act: Don\'t attend video meetings at all\n\nOf course, Zoom isn’t oblivious to the fact that dialing into daily video calls may soon become a distant memory reserved for the pandemic days—in fact, that’s a scenario it claims to be ready for.\n\n“Even when people are all back in the office, there\'s still a use case for Zoom,” Geddes said, pointing to the company’s foray into AI.\n\n“We have customers that they\'re in a conference room, there\'s no remote participant, and guess what? They\'re having AI companion automate the note-taking of that meeting, summarize the next steps and action items,” Geddes explained. “No remote participant. No video being used. But there\'s still value in the Zoom platform participating in that session.”\n\nPerhaps more surprisingly, the company plans to encourage people to ditch attending video meetings altogether, thanks to this technology.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/\n\nSource 1:\nMeanwhile, it similarly acquired Workvivo last year for around €250 million <https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/workvivos-revenue-and-losses-doubled-prior-to-zoom-takeover/a81188355.html#:~:text=The%20Cork%20tech%20firm%20Workvivo,loss%20of%20the%20year%20before.> ($272 million). \n\nThe employee engagement tool, which acts like Slack but has an interface similar to Facebook <https://fortune.com/company/facebook/>, is now being used by the likes of Amazon <https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/>, Bupa <https://fortune.com/company/bupa/>, and Ryanair—and, as Geddes points out, “has nothing to do with video.”\n\n“We\'re helping our customers in the way that their customers show up to their website, having a chatbot automation service that can escalate into a phone call,” Geddes added. “A lot of workflows that have no video involved.”\n\nZoom needs a second act if it wants to remain relevant\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/\n\nSource 1:\nZoom needs a second act if it wants to remain relevant\n\nIt’s no coincidence that Zoom is shifting away from being known as a chief enabler of video meetings, as businesses are increasingly distancing themselves from the pandemic-era work style. \n\nLast autumn alone, some 1 million workers were issued RTO mandates <https://fortune.com/2023/08/25/labor-day-return-to-office-mandates-employee-attendance-rates/>. \n\nNow bosses are increasingly demanding workers come in five days a week <https://fortune.com/europe/2024/03/12/boots-return-to-office-5-day-ceo-women-working-moms/?asdfgh>, practically removing the need for workers to dial into meetings remotely—and Zoom’s stock has tanked back to pre-pandemic levels as a result. \n\nIn October 2020, Zoom’s shares rose to a peak of $559—up from around $66 at the end of 2019—but they’re now back to around the $60 mark. \n\n“At the start of the pandemic, I think there were tons of people who flocked to Zoom,” Jacqueline Barrett, economist and founder of the Bright Arc, tells Fortune.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/\n\nSource 2:\nIt turns out that jet-setting on the company dime has eternal appeal.

"Can we have a quick catch-up in the kitchen?" was suddenly replaced with a simple "Zoom?"\n\nBut now, the $19 billion video-calling giant no longer wants to be known for the very thing that made it famous. \n\nZoom is “so much more than just video meetings,” Graeme Geddes, Zoom’s chief growth officer, told Fortune. “Video is our heritage—so we\'re going to continue to lean in there, push the market, there\'s a lot of innovation that we\'re doing—but we\'re so much more than that.”\n\nSo what does the company primarily known for enabling remote workers to connect through a screen want to be known as going forward? \n\n“We want to be known as an AI-first collaboration platform,” Geddes responded.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/\n\nSource 1:\n“There was probably a little bit of overexcitement in terms of the stock, with people anticipating that the growth was going to be like that indefinitely, and then with the increased competition, I think that growth or maintaining all those users was difficult for them to do,” Barrett explains.\n\nIn addition to return-to-office mandates resulting in fewer people requiring Zoom’s services on a day-to-day basis, workers now have more platforms than ever to choose from. \n\nIt’s why, she says, Zoom has to highlight that it offers more than just video-calling services.\n\n“There\'s so many other players in the market that are offering these new features that have already bundled things together or that are constantly unveiling new features with generative AI. If it\'s not the legacy players like Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> or Microsoft <https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/> or Cisco, there\'s so many startups that are focused on pretty much every little niche imaginable with generative AI," Barrett says. "So you have to stay up to date.

Thanks to the platform’s smart summary, Geddes boasted that he was able to wake up in the morning and act on whatever was discussed in his absence.\n\n“I was empowered; I didn\'t attend the meeting. Had a good idea of what was discussed,” he added. “Now, how much time would I have lost if I waited two weeks to get back and the teams were waiting for me to make that decision?”\n\n“So that leads to the conversation about: If I can get a summary, is there an option for my virtual assistant to show up on my behalf? So this is a natural evolution that we\'ll see of the platform of how we can deliver more value to our customers.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/zoomthe-video-calls-covid-pandemic-ai-collaboration/\n\nSource 1:\nZoom\'s next act: Don\'t attend video meetings at all\n\nOf course, Zoom isn’t oblivious to the fact that dialing into daily video calls may soon become a distant memory reserved for the pandemic days—in fact, that’s a scenario it claims to be ready for.\n\n“Even when people are all back in the office, there\'s still a use case for Zoom,” Geddes said, pointing to the company’s foray into AI.\n\n“We have customers that they\'re in a conference room, there\'s no remote participant, and guess what?

As a result of its popularity, Zoom's stock price skyrocketed, reaching a peak of $559 in October 2020, up from around $66 at the end of 2019 [1]. However, with the return to in-person work and increased competition from other video conferencing platforms, Zoom's stock price has since declined to around $60 [1]. Despite this, Zoom remains a leading player in the video conferencing market and is now focusing on expanding its offerings beyond video meetings to become an "AI-first collaboration platform" [1].

2024-11-08 06:41:47,005: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The company known for its video conferencing software, particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, is Zoom [1]. Zoom's video conferencing platform became a household name during the pandemic, with the number of daily meeting participants increasing from 10 million in December 2019 to 300 million in April 2020 [2]. This rapid growth was largely due to the shift to remote work and the need for virtual communication tools.

As a result of its popularity, Zoom's stock price skyrocketed, reaching a peak of $559 in October 2020, up from around $66 at the end of 2019 [1]. However, with the return to in-person work and increased competition from other video conferencing platforms, Zoom's stock price has since declined to around $60 [1]. Despite this, Zoom remains a leading player in the video conferencing market and is now focusing on expanding its offerings beyond video meetings to become an "AI-first collaboration platform" [1].

2024-11-08 06:41:47,118: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The company known for its video conferencing software, particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, is Zoom [1]. Zoom's video conferencing platform became a household name during the pandemic, with the number of daily meeting participants increasing from 10 million in December 2019 to 300 million in April 2020 [2]. This rapid growth was largely due to the shift to remote work and the need for virtual communication tools.

As a result of its popularity, Zoom's stock price skyrocketed, reaching a peak of $559 in October 2020, up from around $66 at the end of 2019 [1]. However, with the return to in-person work and increased competition from other video conferencing platforms, Zoom's stock price has since declined to around $60 [1]. Despite this, Zoom remains a leading player in the video conferencing market and is now focusing on expanding its offerings beyond video meetings to become an "AI-first collaboration platform" [1].

Zoom's video conferencing platform became a household name during the pandemic, with the number of daily meeting participants increasing from 10 million in December 2019 to 300 million in April 2020 [2]. This rapid growth was largely due to the shift to remote work and the need for virtual communication tools.

As a result of its popularity, Zoom's stock price skyrocketed, reaching a peak of $559 in October 2020, up from around $66 at the end of 2019 [1]. However, with the return to in-person work and increased competition from other video conferencing platforms, Zoom's stock price has since declined to around $60 [1]. Despite this, Zoom remains a leading player in the video conferencing market and is now focusing on expanding its offerings beyond video meetings to become an "AI-first collaboration platform" [1].

Zoom's video conferencing platform became a household name during the pandemic, with the number of daily meeting participants increasing from 10 million in December 2019 to 300 million in April 2020 [2]. This rapid growth was largely due to the shift to remote work and the need for virtual communication tools.

As a result of its popularity, Zoom's stock price skyrocketed, reaching a peak of $559 in October 2020, up from around $66 at the end of 2019 [1]. However, with the return to in-person work and increased competition from other video conferencing platforms, Zoom's stock price has since declined to around $60 [1]. Despite this, Zoom remains a leading player in the video conferencing market and is now focusing on expanding its offerings beyond video meetings to become an "AI-first collaboration platform" [1].

Zoom's impact on the way people work and communicate has been significant, and it continues to be a major player in the virtual communication space. Its platform has been used by a wide range of organizations,

Zoom's video conferencing platform became a household name during the pandemic, with the number of daily meeting participants increasing from 10 million in December 2019 to 300 million in April 2020 [2]. This rapid growth was largely due to the shift to remote work and the need for virtual communication tools.

As a result of its popularity, Zoom's stock price skyrocketed, reaching a peak of $559 in October 2020, up from around $66 at the end of 2019 [1]. However, with the return to in-person work and increased competition from other video conferencing platforms, Zoom's stock price has since declined to around $60 [1]. Despite this, Zoom remains a leading player in the video conferencing market and is now focusing on expanding its offerings beyond video meetings to become an "AI-first collaboration platform" [1].

2024-11-08 06:41:49,072: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The company known for its video conferencing software, particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, is Zoom [1]. Zoom's video conferencing platform became a household name during the pandemic, with the number of daily meeting participants increasing from 10 million in December 2019 to 300 million in April 2020 [2]. This rapid growth was largely due to the shift to remote work and the need for virtual communication tools.

As a result of its popularity, Zoom's stock price skyrocketed, reaching a peak of $559 in October 2020, up from around $66 at the end of 2019 [1]. However, with the return to in-person work and increased competition from other video conferencing platforms, Zoom's stock price has since declined to around $60 [1]. Despite this, Zoom remains a leading player in the video conferencing market and is now focusing on expanding its offerings beyond video meetings to become an "AI-first collaboration platform" [1].

Zoom's impact on the way people work and communicate has been significant, and it continues to be a major player in the virtual communication space. Its platform has been used by a wide range of organizations, from small businesses to large corporations, and has enabled people to stay connected and productive remotely [4].

As a result of its popularity, Zoom's stock price skyrocketed, reaching a peak of $559 in October 2020, up from around $66 at the end of 2019 [1]. However, with the return to in-person work and increased competition from other video conferencing platforms, Zoom's stock price has since declined to around $60 [1]. Despite this, Zoom remains a leading player in the video conferencing market and is now focusing on expanding its offerings beyond video meetings to become an "AI-first collaboration platform" [1].

Zoom's impact on the way people work and communicate has been significant, and it continues to be a major player in the virtual communication space. Its platform has been used by a wide range of organizations, from small businesses to large corporations, and has enabled people to stay connected and productive remotely [4].

2024-11-08 06:41:49,396: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The company known for its video conferencing software, particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, is Zoom [1]. Zoom's video conferencing platform became a household name during the pandemic, with the number of daily meeting participants increasing from 10 million in December 2019 to 300 million in April 2020 [2]. This rapid growth was largely due to the shift to remote work and the need for virtual communication tools.

As a result of its popularity, Zoom's stock price skyrocketed, reaching a peak of $559 in October 2020, up from around $66 at the end of 2019 [1]. However, with the return to in-person work and increased competition from other video conferencing platforms, Zoom's stock price has since declined to around $60 [1]. Despite this, Zoom remains a leading player in the video conferencing market and is now focusing on expanding its offerings beyond video meetings to become an "AI-first collaboration platform" [1].

Zoom's impact on the way people work and communicate has been significant, and it continues to be a major player in the virtual communication space. Its platform has been used by a wide range of organizations, from small businesses to large corporations, and has enabled people to stay connected and productive remotely [4].

2024-11-08 06:41:49,551: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The company known for its video conferencing software, particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, is Zoom [1]. Zoom's video conferencing platform became a household name during the pandemic, with the number of daily meeting participants increasing from 10 million in December 2019 to 300 million in April 2020 [2]. This rapid growth was largely due to the shift to remote work and the need for virtual communication tools.

As a result of its popularity, Zoom's stock price skyrocketed, reaching a peak of $559 in October 2020, up from around $66 at the end of 2019 [1]. However, with the return to in-person work and increased competition from other video conferencing platforms, Zoom's stock price has since declined to around $60 [1]. Despite this, Zoom remains a leading player in the video conferencing market and is now focusing on expanding its offerings beyond video meetings to become an "AI-first collaboration platform" [1].

Zoom's impact on the way people work and communicate has been significant, and it continues to be a major player in the virtual communication space. Its platform has been used by a wide range of organizations, from small businesses to large corporations, and has enabled people to stay connected and productive remotely [4]. As the company continues to evolve and expand its offerings, it will be interesting to see how it adapts to the changing needs of its users and the market. [1

2024-11-08 06:41:49,666: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: Which company is known for its video conferencing software, particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic?

2024-11-08 06:41:49,667: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The company known for its video conferencing software, particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, is Zoom [1]. Zoom's video conferencing platform became a household name during the pandemic, with the number of daily meeting participants increasing from 10 million in December 2019 to 300 million in April 2020 [2]. This rapid growth was largely due to the shift to remote work and the need for virtual communication tools.

As a result of its popularity, Zoom's stock price skyrocketed, reaching a peak of $559 in October 2020, up from around $66 at the end of 2019 [1]. However, with the return to in-person work and increased competition from other video conferencing platforms, Zoom's stock price has since declined to around $60 [1]. Despite this, Zoom remains a leading player in the video conferencing market and is now focusing on expanding its offerings beyond video meetings to become an "AI-first collaboration platform" [1].

Zoom's impact on the way people work and communicate has been significant, and it continues to be a major player in the virtual communication space. Its platform has been used by a wide range of organizations, from small businesses to large corporations, and has enabled people to stay connected and productive remotely [4]. As the company continues to evolve and expand its offerings, it will be interesting to see how it adapts to the changing needs of its users and the market. [1]
