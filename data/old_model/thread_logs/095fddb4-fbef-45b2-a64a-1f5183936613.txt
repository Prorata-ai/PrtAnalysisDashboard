Nevertheless, businessmen are behaving as if national borders had already disappeared. They are merging and consolidating, forming joint ventures, and setting up bases to assault new markets. The resulting upheaval must be what Jean Monnet, prophet of European union, had in mind when he predicted that the Common Market would touch off "a second industrial revolution." Like any revolution, this one has plenty of confusion, uncertainty, and casualties. As patterns of competition change and artificially protected preserves are opened up, weak firms must seek shelter or get trampled upon and strong ones cannot take their strength for granted. Yet everyone seems to be looking forward with gusto to the test. A few businessmen expressed concern about what the Common Market might do to their immediate prospects, but none even hinted that he would like to see the process stopped or reversed.

National borders have presented little impediment to a steady stream of mergers and acquisitions, which, along with buoyant capital markets, has elevated several MNCs to asset values north of $1 trillion. That’s why de-concentration does not imply descaling or fragmentation. The reglobalized landscape will see an unprecedented scale of strategically aligned business activity. The landscape also features massive, complex, multinational organizations whose geographic origins and legal domiciles are increasingly blurred and whose economic dimensions exceed many nations in the world.

But we are not here to argue that all digital barriers must come down. As researchers from academic institutions in the U.S. (Harvard), Europe (INSEAD), and China (Tsinghua), and from a global company (Boston Consulting Group), we recognize that governments will continue to feel an obligation to protect their national security interests and citizens’ data. If anything, we may see more barriers erected in the years to come. But we shouldn’t—in fact, we can’t—give up on cross-border data sharing.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/ai-artificial-intelligence-cross-border-data-sharing/\n\nSource 1:\nRecent events have illustrated the positive impact of sharing—not only within industries (as we have recently argued <https://fortune.com/2024/05/03/potential-unleashed-data-sharing-bcg/>) but also across borders. For example, it took Mayo Clinic <https://fortune.com/company/mayo-clinic/> researchers in the United States just six weeks <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00147-9/fulltext> to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases. This experience, though enabled by the exceptional circumstance of a global pandemic <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-023-00773-0>, is still illustrative of the power of sharing. But if the rise in data regulation continues at its current rate, such cross-border data sharing will become more and more difficult. This would have major implications, both on the global economy and on our collective ability to address issues that can only be solved by using data from multiple countries, such as anticipating natural disasters\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/ai-artificial-intelligence-cross-border-data-sharing/\n\nSource 1:\nWhether preparing for the next pandemic or monitoring the safety of generative AI, policymakers, business leaders, and academics need access to data from both within and outside their national borders. But instead of policies that enable data to flow more freely, constraints have become the norm. Globally, data flow restrictions more than doubled between 2017 and 2021 <https://itif.org/publications/2021/07/19/how-barriers-cross-border-data-flows-are-spreading-globally-what-they-cost/>. Late last year, the U.S. withdrew its long-standing request for the WTO <https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-drops-digital-trade-demands-wto-allow-room-stronger-tech-regulation-2023-10-25/> to prohibit data localization requirements for e-commerce.

Nevertheless, businessmen are behaving as if national borders had already disappeared. They are merging and consolidating, forming joint ventures, and setting up bases to assault new markets. The resulting upheaval must be what Jean Monnet, prophet of European union, had in mind when he predicted that the Common Market would touch off "a second industrial revolution." Like any revolution, this one has plenty of confusion, uncertainty, and casualties. As patterns of competition change and artificially protected preserves are opened up, weak firms must seek shelter or get trampled upon and strong ones cannot take their strength for granted. Yet everyone seems to be looking forward with gusto to the test. A few businessmen expressed concern about what the Common Market might do to their immediate prospects, but none even hinted that he would like to see the process stopped or reversed. The business community that started out with the best reasons to be frightened now embraces the new adventure with the most enthusiasm. A few years ago France looked like the weak sister of Europe. Its politics were in disorder, its morale depressed by the impasse in Algeria. Moreover, its notoriously inefficient industry, fragmented into old, tariff-protected family firms, seemed\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/old-europes-young-again-and-fretting-fortune-classics-1963/\n\nSource 3:\nThe critical takeaway is that we need to consider scenarios for the 2030s <https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/geopolitical-risk-rising-how-ceos-prepare>—a time horizon beyond the typical two-to-three-year corporate planning cycle, but not so distant that the scenarios are too theoretical or academic to be useful.\n\nHow geopolitics could reshape the world by 2032\n\nThe least likely scenario today—because of stagnant WTO reforms, the UN’s inability to stop conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, and the rise of protectionist industrial policies <>— <>is a return to the days of global cooperation and peace. Western-values-based global institutions and peace mechanisms would regain dominance, and as sanctions and conflicts recede, global trade would reach historic highs.\n\nA more likely scenario envisions the proliferation of regional conflicts. Although total global trade would be stable, regionalization would shift its flows, and supply shocks would multiply. These disruptions would strain commodity markets, while sanctions complicate capital flows. Global talent flows would also be obstructed.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/07/geopolitics-4-potential-scenarios-map-world-trade-goods-next-decade-bcg-politics/\n\nSource 4:\n"neutrals," are militarily defenseless in the ordinary sense. At best they will acquire destructive capabilities of their own, as Britain is now doing. Consequently, the "concert of powers"--or its equivalent international organization--rests on a basis much more fragile than ever before. The situation is further embroiled by the newly achieved political effectiveness of non-European nationalisms. These factors would "normally"--that is, in any recent century--have led to war. Will they lead to war before 1980? Or soon thereafter? It would be presumptuous to try to answer such a question firmly. In any case, the present and the near future are both dangerous. While the immediate problem is to cope with the actual danger, it is also essential to envisage how the problem is going to evolve in the 1955-80 period, even assuming that all will go reasonably well for the moment. This does not mean belittling immediate problems of weaponry, of U.S.-U.S.S.R. tensions, of the evolution and revolutions of Asia. These first things must come first. But we must be ready for the follow-up, lest possible immediate successes prove futile. We must think beyond the present forms of problems to those of later decades.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/can-we-survive-technology/\n\nSource 5:\nSuch interconnectedness that blurs the lines separating nations, complicates the whole idea of imposing sanctions on one nation or another. As a result, Smith is skeptical that the tariffs imposed on imports by both Biden and Trump before him will resolve the geopolitical tension. To support his skepticism, he cites research <https://www.ft.com/content/497ca6af-1565-443a-ad18-3e9180d04d5e> by the Financial Times that he says shows tariffs slow trade for everyone. Instead, he thinks properly recognizing the interconnectedness of global markets might lead to more measured solutions.\n\n“Everybody looks at China as a monolithic entity," he said.

This morning marks the opening of the 79th session of the UN General Assembly in New York. Along with attracting heads of state and their teams, the week-long event also brings a mix of global business leaders to town. While many want to dismiss and even defund the UN, consider how many of its agencies enable business to operate at a global level <https://fortune.com/2024/09/18/american-businesses-unga-united-nations-economy-politics/>. Consider how many of these meetings may open doors for new trade or business opportunities. \n\nIt\'s easy to divide the world into good and bad, or them and us. As the head of a far-right government, Giorgia Meloni sparked as much fear as rejoicing when she became Italy’s first female prime minister two years ago. And yet she has proven to be more of a defender of rights <https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/24/giorgia-melonis-not-so-scary-right-wing-government> than someone who tramples on them, committed to protecting democratic institutions.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/italian-prime-minister-giorgia-meloni-elon-musk/\n\nSource 7:\nLarge global businesses are not passive or reactive players in the emerging reglobalized world. Businesses expand and consolidate through organic growth and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity, often crossing many borders in the process. Their financial scale, internal trade (with each other and amongst their own subsidiaries), and investments are themselves among the most powerful change agents shaping the future of world trade and investment.\n\nThe era of supply chain and market growth concentration has come to an end, and with it, the singular focus on cost efficiency at the expense of risk management. How C-suites approach key strategic planning choices will be ever more challenging as scale, complexity, and enabling technologies such as AI evolve, not to mention geopolitical, climate, economic, and consumer developments.\n\nThinking in terms of ‘world states’\n\nReglobalization is going to be turbulent and non-linear in its progression. When working with executives, we encourage the development of a mutually exclusive, completely exhaustive (MECE) set of scenarios on a spectrum that ranges from everyone all over the world holding hands to a major regional war. The more probable scenarios are in the middle. In developing the scenarios, three or four realistic ones are sufficient.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/05/world-reglobalizing-multinationals-business-us-china-geopolitics-tariffs-trade-leadership/\n\nSource 8:\nNot long ago, globalization seemed an irresistible force, making physical and virtual boundaries obsolete. However, geopolitics inevitably set in, leading to a divided world once again. \n\nToday, technology is a leading driver of that fragmentation. Our global ambitions to create the most innovative, efficient, and groundbreaking technologies puts us on the brink of transformative scientific breakthroughs—but it also presents a challenge. Nearly every civilian technology could be adapted to have military applications, which makes innovation increasingly complex and contentious. \n\nIn a world where any technology can be used for both benign and destructive ends, scientists and entrepreneurs are being forced to consider more than just the intended application of their products. This responsibility imposes an excessive burden on innovators, forcing them to ponder the potential misuse of products and come up with mechanisms to thwart any malicious application. \n\nTo be clear, there is nothing new about this dilemma of dual-use technology. However, avoiding these geopolitical and technological traps has become even more complicated.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/16/investors-entrepreneurs-becoming-collateral-damage-us-china-battle-dual-use-tech/\n\nSource 9:\nThe reglobalized landscape\n\nThe de-concentration of manufacturing and associated supply chains is a key process in the reglobalizing world. Notwithstanding the interest in Brazil, India, Eastern Europe, and South East Asian countries, we do not expect any emerging market or supply hub to dominate the attention of investors to the degree China did. MNC executives show little interest in a new over-concentration scenario.\n\nA visible trend in recent years for many MNCs has been restructuring equity and control of entities within their constellations of business activities for tax efficiency, sanction compliance, tariff management, and resiliency. National borders have presented little impediment to a steady stream of mergers and acquisitions, which, along with buoyant capital markets, has elevated several MNCs to asset values north of $1 trillion. That’s why de-concentration does not imply descaling or fragmentation. The reglobalized landscape will see an unprecedented scale of strategically aligned business activity. The landscape also features massive, complex, multinational organizations whose geographic origins and legal domiciles are increasingly blurred and whose economic dimensions exceed many nations in the world. The degree to which their commercial decisions align with and influence government policies will be a significant dynamic in reglobalization.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/us-china-competition-benefiting-worldand-global-economy-supply-chains-politics-leadership/\n\nSource 10:\nGood morning,\n\nFor most Fortune 500 CEOs, globalization is a given. Their challenge is figuring out how to navigate geopolitics while conducting business in a connected world. We convened two dozen members of the Fortune CEO Initiative yesterday for a candid conversation with Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer, who consults with leaders worldwide. Here are a few of his comments:\n\nOn China: “Along with neither side wanting escalating tensions, the Americans and Chinese are increasingly dominant in different and complementary technologies. The Chinese, on everything around the post-carbon transition—not just EVs and batteries and the critical mineral supply chain, but also solar and wind and nuclear at scale. The Americans, on the other hand, [are] increasingly dominant in AI, large language models and frontier models, and the funding for that.”\n\n“If the Chinese want to regulate to ensure that their own population doesn\'t have access to good AI models and the Americans want to regulate to ensure that American citizens have to drive crappy, expensive EVs, we\'re both capable of doing that. But the rest of the world isn\'t going to do that and that is going to be a driver of more intellectual capital and capital and goods and services moving across borders all over the world.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/ian-bremmer-gaza-ukraine-wars-markets-eurasia-group/'}

Nearly every civilian technology could be adapted to have military applications, which makes innovation increasingly complex and contentious. \n\nIn a world where any technology can be used for both benign and destructive ends, scientists and entrepreneurs are being forced to consider more than just the intended application of their products. This responsibility imposes an excessive burden on innovators, forcing them to ponder the potential misuse of products and come up with mechanisms to thwart any malicious application. \n\nTo be clear, there is nothing new about this dilemma of dual-use technology. However, avoiding these geopolitical and technological traps has become even more complicated.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/16/investors-entrepreneurs-becoming-collateral-damage-us-china-battle-dual-use-tech/\n\nSource 9:\nThe reglobalized landscape\n\nThe de-concentration of manufacturing and associated supply chains is a key process in the reglobalizing world. Notwithstanding the interest in Brazil, India, Eastern Europe, and South East Asian countries, we do not expect any emerging market or supply hub to dominate the attention of investors to the degree China did. MNC executives show little interest in a new over-concentration scenario.\n\nA visible trend in recent years for many MNCs has been restructuring equity and control of entities within their constellations of business activities for tax efficiency, sanction compliance, tariff management, and resiliency. National borders have presented little impediment to a steady stream of mergers and acquisitions, which, along with buoyant capital markets, has elevated several MNCs to asset values north of $1 trillion. That’s why de-concentration does not imply descaling or fragmentation. The reglobalized landscape will see an unprecedented scale of strategically aligned business activity. The landscape also features massive, complex, multinational organizations whose geographic origins and legal domiciles are increasingly blurred and whose economic dimensions exceed many nations in the world. The degree to which their commercial decisions align with and influence government policies will be a significant dynamic in reglobalization.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/us-china-competition-benefiting-worldand-global-economy-supply-chains-politics-leadership/\n\nSource 10:\nGood morning,\n\nFor most Fortune 500 CEOs, globalization is a given. Their challenge is figuring out how to navigate geopolitics while conducting business in a connected world. We convened two dozen members of the Fortune CEO Initiative yesterday for a candid conversation with Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer, who consults with leaders worldwide. Here are a few of his comments:\n\nOn China: “Along with neither side wanting escalating tensions, the Americans and Chinese are increasingly dominant in different and complementary technologies. The Chinese, on everything around the post-carbon transition—not just EVs and batteries and the critical mineral supply chain, but also solar and wind and nuclear at scale. The Americans, on the other hand, [are] increasingly dominant in AI, large language models and frontier models, and the funding for that.”\n\n“If the Chinese want to regulate to ensure that their own population doesn\'t have access to good AI models and the Americans want to regulate to ensure that American citizens have to drive crappy, expensive EVs, we\'re both capable of doing that. But the rest of the world isn\'t going to do that and that is going to be a driver of more intellectual capital and capital and goods and services moving across borders all over the world.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/ian-bremmer-gaza-ukraine-wars-markets-eurasia-group/'}

This responsibility imposes an excessive burden on innovators, forcing them to ponder the potential misuse of products and come up with mechanisms to thwart any malicious application. \n\nTo be clear, there is nothing new about this dilemma of dual-use technology. However, avoiding these geopolitical and technological traps has become even more complicated.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/16/investors-entrepreneurs-becoming-collateral-damage-us-china-battle-dual-use-tech/\n\nSource 9:\nThe reglobalized landscape\n\nThe de-concentration of manufacturing and associated supply chains is a key process in the reglobalizing world. Notwithstanding the interest in Brazil, India, Eastern Europe, and South East Asian countries, we do not expect any emerging market or supply hub to dominate the attention of investors to the degree China did. MNC executives show little interest in a new over-concentration scenario.\n\nA visible trend in recent years for many MNCs has been restructuring equity and control of entities within their constellations of business activities for tax efficiency, sanction compliance, tariff management, and resiliency. National borders have presented little impediment to a steady stream of mergers and acquisitions, which, along with buoyant capital markets, has elevated several MNCs to asset values north of $1 trillion. That’s why de-concentration does not imply descaling or fragmentation. The reglobalized landscape will see an unprecedented scale of strategically aligned business activity. The landscape also features massive, complex, multinational organizations whose geographic origins and legal domiciles are increasingly blurred and whose economic dimensions exceed many nations in the world. The degree to which their commercial decisions align with and influence government policies will be a significant dynamic in reglobalization.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/us-china-competition-benefiting-worldand-global-economy-supply-chains-politics-leadership/\n\nSource 10:\nGood morning,\n\nFor most Fortune 500 CEOs, globalization is a given. Their challenge is figuring out how to navigate geopolitics while conducting business in a connected world. We convened two dozen members of the Fortune CEO Initiative yesterday for a candid conversation with Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer, who consults with leaders worldwide. Here are a few of his comments:\n\nOn China: “Along with neither side wanting escalating tensions, the Americans and Chinese are increasingly dominant in different and complementary technologies. The Chinese, on everything around the post-carbon transition—not just EVs and batteries and the critical mineral supply chain, but also solar and wind and nuclear at scale. The Americans, on the other hand, [are] increasingly dominant in AI, large language models and frontier models, and the funding for that.”\n\n“If the Chinese want to regulate to ensure that their own population doesn\'t have access to good AI models and the Americans want to regulate to ensure that American citizens have to drive crappy, expensive EVs, we\'re both capable of doing that. But the rest of the world isn\'t going to do that and that is going to be a driver of more intellectual capital and capital and goods and services moving across borders all over the world.”\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/ian-bremmer-gaza-ukraine-wars-markets-eurasia-group/'}

But we are not here to argue that all digital barriers must come down. As researchers from academic institutions in the U.S. (Harvard), Europe (INSEAD), and China (Tsinghua), and from a global company (Boston Consulting Group), we recognize that governments will continue to feel an obligation to protect their national security interests and citizens’ data. If anything, we may see more barriers erected in the years to come. But we shouldn’t—in fact, we can’t—give up on cross-border data sharing.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/ai-artificial-intelligence-cross-border-data-sharing/\n\nSource 1:\nRecent events have illustrated the positive impact of sharing—not only within industries (as we have recently argued <https://fortune.com/2024/05/03/potential-unleashed-data-sharing-bcg/>) but also across borders. For example, it took Mayo Clinic <https://fortune.com/company/mayo-clinic/> researchers in the United States just six weeks <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00147-9/fulltext> to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases. This experience, though enabled by the exceptional circumstance of a global pandemic <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-023-00773-0>, is still illustrative of the power of sharing. But if the rise in data regulation continues at its current rate, such cross-border data sharing will become more and more difficult. This would have major implications, both on the global economy and on our collective ability to address issues that can only be solved by using data from multiple countries, such as anticipating natural disasters\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/ai-artificial-intelligence-cross-border-data-sharing/\n\nSource 1:\nWhether preparing for the next pandemic or monitoring the safety of generative AI, policymakers, business leaders, and academics need access to data from both within and outside their national borders. But instead of policies that enable data to flow more freely, constraints have become the norm. Globally, data flow restrictions more than doubled between 2017 and 2021 <https://itif.org/publications/2021/07/19/how-barriers-cross-border-data-flows-are-spreading-globally-what-they-cost/>. Late last year, the U.S. withdrew its long-standing request for the WTO <https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-drops-digital-trade-demands-wto-allow-room-stronger-tech-regulation-2023-10-25/> to prohibit data localization requirements for e-commerce. This is a highly symbolic move from a country that has traditionally been one of the staunchest supporters of tearing down barriers in the digital world.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/ai-artificial-intelligence-cross-border-data-sharing/\n\nSource 2:\nat 50 percent of their former levels, and a number of other, more subtle trade restrictions remain in force. Nevertheless, businessmen are behaving as if national borders had already disappeared. They are merging and consolidating, forming joint ventures, and setting up bases to assault new markets. The resulting upheaval must be what Jean Monnet, prophet of European union, had in mind when he predicted that the Common Market would touch off "a second industrial revolution." Like any revolution, this one has plenty of confusion, uncertainty, and casualties. As patterns of competition change and artificially protected preserves are opened up, weak firms must seek shelter or get trampled upon and strong ones cannot take their strength for granted. Yet everyone seems to be looking forward with gusto to the test. A few businessmen expressed concern about what the Common Market might do to their immediate prospects, but none even hinted that he would like to see the process stopped or reversed. The business community that started out with the best reasons to be frightened now embraces the new adventure with the most enthusiasm. A few years ago France looked like the weak sister of Europe. Its politics were in disorder, its morale depressed by the impasse in Algeria. Moreover, its notoriously inefficient industry, fragmented into old, tariff-protected family firms, seemed\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/old-europes-young-again-and-fretting-fortune-classics-1963/\n\nSource 3:\nThe critical takeaway is that we need to consider scenarios for the 2030s <https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/geopolitical-risk-rising-how-ceos-prepare>—a time horizon beyond the typical two-to-three-year corporate planning cycle, but not so distant that the scenarios are too theoretical or academic to be useful.\n\nHow geopolitics could reshape the world by 2032\n\nThe least likely scenario today—because of stagnant WTO reforms, the UN’s inability to stop conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, and the rise of protectionist industrial policies <>— <>is a return to the days of global cooperation and peace. Western-values-based global institutions and peace mechanisms would regain dominance, and as sanctions and conflicts recede, global trade would reach historic highs.\n\nA more likely scenario envisions the proliferation of regional conflicts. Although total global trade would be stable, regionalization would shift its flows, and supply shocks would multiply. These disruptions would strain commodity markets, while sanctions complicate capital flows. Global talent flows would also be obstructed.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/08/07/geopolitics-4-potential-scenarios-map-world-trade-goods-next-decade-bcg-politics/\n\nSource 4:\n"neutrals," are militarily defenseless in the ordinary sense. At best they will acquire destructive capabilities of their own, as Britain is now doing. Consequently, the "concert of powers"--or its equivalent international organization--rests on a basis much more fragile than ever before. The situation is further embroiled by the newly achieved political effectiveness of non-European nationalisms. These factors would "normally"--that is, in any recent century--have led to war. Will they lead to war before 1980? Or soon thereafter? It would be presumptuous to try to answer such a question firmly. In any case, the present and the near future are both dangerous. While the immediate problem is to cope with the actual danger, it is also essential to envisage how the problem is going to evolve in the 1955-80 period, even assuming that all will go reasonably well for the moment. This does not mean belittling immediate problems of weaponry, of U.S.-U.S.S.R. tensions, of the evolution and revolutions of Asia. These first things must come first. But we must be ready for the follow-up, lest possible immediate successes prove futile. We must think beyond the present forms of problems to those of later decades.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/can-we-survive-technology/\n\nSource 5:\nSuch interconnectedness that blurs the lines separating nations, complicates the whole idea of imposing sanctions on one nation or another. As a result, Smith is skeptical that the tariffs imposed on imports by both Biden and Trump before him will resolve the geopolitical tension. To support his skepticism, he cites research <https://www.ft.com/content/497ca6af-1565-443a-ad18-3e9180d04d5e> by the Financial Times that he says shows tariffs slow trade for everyone. Instead, he thinks properly recognizing the interconnectedness of global markets might lead to more measured solutions.\n\n“Everybody looks at China as a monolithic entity," he said. "There\'s a business class in China that doesn\'t want to be wiped out either, as China has become more protectionist. And if you go into a FedEx hub today, you\'ll be amazed at the choreography of stuff going from every part in the world to every other part in the world.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/10/17/fedex-founder-says-corporate-data-predicted-the-rise-of-tesla-and-nvidiaand-can-flag-new-trends/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/10/17/fedex-founder-says-corporate-data-predicted-the-rise-of-tesla-and-nvidiaand-can-flag-new-trends/\n\nSource 6:\nBut let’s not ignore politics. This morning marks the opening of the 79th session of the UN General Assembly in New York. Along with attracting heads of state and their teams, the week-long event also brings a mix of global business leaders to town. While many want to dismiss and even defund the UN, consider how many of its agencies enable business to operate at a global level <https://fortune.com/2024/09/18/american-businesses-unga-united-nations-economy-politics/>. Consider how many of these meetings may open doors for new trade or business opportunities. \n\nIt\'s easy to divide the world into good and bad, or them and us. As the head of a far-right government, Giorgia Meloni sparked as much fear as rejoicing when she became Italy’s first female prime minister two years ago. And yet she has proven to be more of a defender of rights <https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/24/giorgia-melonis-not-so-scary-right-wing-government> than someone who tramples on them, committed to protecting democratic institutions.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/italian-prime-minister-giorgia-meloni-elon-musk/\n\nSource 7:\nLarge global businesses are not passive or reactive players in the emerging reglobalized world. Businesses expand and consolidate through organic growth and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity, often crossing many borders in the process. Their financial scale, internal trade (with each other and amongst their own subsidiaries), and investments are themselves among the most powerful change agents shaping the future of world trade and investment.\n\nThe era of supply chain and market growth concentration has come to an end, and with it, the singular focus on cost efficiency at the expense of risk management. How C-suites approach key strategic planning choices will be ever more challenging as scale, complexity, and enabling technologies such as AI evolve, not to mention geopolitical, climate, economic, and consumer developments.\n\nThinking in terms of ‘world states’\n\nReglobalization is going to be turbulent and non-linear in its progression. When working with executives, we encourage the development of a mutually exclusive, completely exhaustive (MECE) set of scenarios on a spectrum that ranges from everyone all over the world holding hands to a major regional war. The more probable scenarios are in the middle. In developing the scenarios, three or four realistic ones are sufficient.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/09/05/world-reglobalizing-multinationals-business-us-china-geopolitics-tariffs-trade-leadership/\n\nSource 8:\nNot long ago, globalization seemed an irresistible force, making physical and virtual boundaries obsolete.

According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence

According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions

According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have

According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing

According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted

2024-11-08 06:43:47,162: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there were no borders between countries, it would likely have a significant impact on global trade, economies, and societies. According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1].

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1].

2024-11-08 06:43:48,470: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there were no borders between countries, it would likely have a significant impact on global trade, economies, and societies. According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

2024-11-08 06:43:49,408: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there were no borders between countries, it would likely have a significant impact on global trade, economies, and societies. According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts

According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to

2024-11-08 06:43:50,258: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there were no borders between countries, it would likely have a significant impact on global trade, economies, and societies. According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which would

According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3].

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which would lead to stable global trade but with shifted flows and supply shocks

2024-11-08 06:43:50,785: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there were no borders between countries, it would likely have a significant impact on global trade, economies, and societies. According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which would lead to stable global trade but with shifted flows and supply shocks [3].

2024-11-08 06:43:50,867: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there were no borders between countries, it would likely have a significant impact on global trade, economies, and societies. According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which would lead to stable global trade but with shifted flows and supply shocks [3]. Additionally, the removal of borders would require policymakers,

2024-11-08 06:43:51,637: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there were no borders between countries, it would likely have a significant impact on global trade, economies, and societies. According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which would lead to stable global trade but with shifted flows and supply shocks [3]. Additionally, the removal of borders would require policymakers, business leaders, and academics to rethink their approaches to issues such

2024-11-08 06:43:51,652: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there were no borders between countries, it would likely have a significant impact on global trade, economies, and societies. According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which would lead to stable global trade but with shifted flows and supply shocks [3]. Additionally, the removal of borders would require policymakers, business leaders, and academics to rethink their approaches to issues such as data regulation, intellectual property protection, and

2024-11-08 06:43:52,405: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What would happen if there were no borders between countries

2024-11-08 06:43:52,405: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there were no borders between countries, it would likely have a significant impact on global trade, economies, and societies. According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which would lead to stable global trade but with shifted flows and supply shocks [3]. Additionally, the removal of borders would require policymakers, business leaders, and academics to rethink their approaches to issues such as data regulation, intellectual property protection, and global governance [1].

2024-11-08 06:43:53,984: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What would happen if there were no borders between countries

2024-11-08 06:43:53,984: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there were no borders between countries, it would likely have a significant impact on global trade, economies, and societies. According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which would lead to stable global trade but with shifted flows and supply shocks [3]. Additionally, the removal of borders would require policymakers, business leaders, and academics to rethink their approaches to issues such as data regulation, intellectual property protection, and global governance [1].

2024-11-08 06:43:54,529: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What would happen if there were no borders between countries

2024-11-08 06:43:54,529: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there were no borders between countries, it would likely have a significant impact on global trade, economies, and societies. According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which would lead to stable global trade but with shifted flows and supply shocks [3]. Additionally, the removal of borders would require policymakers, business leaders, and academics to rethink their approaches to issues such as data regulation, intellectual property protection, and global governance [1].

According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which would lead to stable global trade but with shifted flows and supply shocks [3]. Additionally, the removal of borders would require policymakers, business leaders, and academics to rethink their approaches to issues such as data regulation, intellectual property protection, and global governance [1]. As Jean Monnet, prophet of European union, predicted, the removal of borders would touch off a "second industrial revolution"

2024-11-08 06:43:55,163: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there were no borders between countries, it would likely have a significant impact on global trade, economies, and societies. According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which would lead to stable global trade but with shifted flows and supply shocks [3]. Additionally, the removal of borders would require policymakers, business leaders, and academics to rethink their approaches to issues such as data regulation, intellectual property protection, and global governance [1]. As Jean Monnet, prophet of European union, predicted, the removal of borders would touch off a "second industrial revolution" with plenty of

2024-11-08 06:43:55,275: ObserveEventsHandler(  197): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress messages: What would happen if there were no borders between countries

2024-11-08 06:43:55,275: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: If there were no borders between countries, it would likely have a significant impact on global trade, economies, and societies. According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which would lead to stable global trade but with shifted flows and supply shocks [3]. Additionally, the removal of borders would require policymakers, business leaders, and academics to rethink their approaches to issues such as data regulation, intellectual property protection, and global governance [1].

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which would lead to stable global trade but with shifted flows and supply shocks [3]. Additionally, the removal of borders would require policymakers, business leaders, and academics to rethink their approaches to issues such as data regulation, intellectual property protection, and global governance [1]. As Jean Monnet, prophet of European union, predicted, the removal of borders would touch off a "second industrial revolution" with plenty of confusion, uncertainty, and casualties [2

2024-11-08 06:43:55,428: ObserveEventsHandler(  206): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd last message: What would happen if there were no borders between countries

2024-11-08 06:43:55,428: ObserveEventsHandler(  207): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatEnd response: assistant: If there were no borders between countries, it would likely have a significant impact on global trade, economies, and societies. According to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, the absence of borders would lead to a surge in the movement of intellectual capital, capital, goods, and services across the world [10]. This, in turn, could result in increased economic growth and development, as countries would be able to specialize in their comparative advantages and trade freely with others.

The removal of borders would also enable the free flow of data, which is essential for the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies [1]. Researchers from academic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and China have recognized the importance of cross-border data sharing, citing the example of Mayo Clinic researchers who were able to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases [1]. Furthermore, FedEx founder Frederick Smith notes that the interconnectedness of global markets makes it difficult to impose sanctions on one nation or another, and that recognizing this interconnectedness could lead to more measured solutions [5].

However, the absence of borders would also raise concerns about national security, data protection, and the potential for regional conflicts [3]. The proliferation of regional conflicts is a more likely scenario in the future, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which would lead to stable global trade but with shifted flows and supply shocks [3]. Additionally, the removal of borders would require policymakers, business leaders, and academics to rethink their approaches to issues such as data regulation, intellectual property protection, and global governance [1]. As Jean Monnet, prophet of European union, predicted, the removal of borders would touch off a "second industrial revolution" with plenty of confusion, uncertainty, and casualties [2].
