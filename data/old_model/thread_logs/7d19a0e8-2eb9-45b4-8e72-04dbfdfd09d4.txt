Full- scale trade and investment will soon resume, as Nelson Mandela calls for an end to all sanctions. Almost certainly, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress will become the first black President of his country after the first truly universal elections are held next spring. On the eve of his visit to the U.S. to receive the Liberty Medal, Mandela was vigorous and erect despite having spent 27 of his 74 years in South African prisons. He talked in Johannesburg with FORTUNE managing editor Marshall Loeb about the future he foresees for South Africa's economy and the important role foreign business will play.

There is a vast potential market, which just needs to be tapped. Is there a role for joint ventures between South African and foreign companies?  Yes, we would welcome that. Are there any sectors of the South African economy that you feel foreign companies should not invest in?  No. Our preoccupation is manufacturing and infrastructure, because these two areas will provide the most employment opportunities. What do you mean by infrastructure?  We have many areas where there are no roads, where there are no schools, where there is no electricity, no running water. Infrastructure would also include ambitious housing schemes, because millions of our people are without accommodation. That is why the whole country is littered with what are called squatter camps, informal settlements. How do you spread stock ownership among the people?

Almost certainly, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress will become the first black President of his country after the first truly universal elections are held next spring. On the eve of his visit to the U.S. to receive the Liberty Medal, Mandela was vigorous and erect despite having spent 27 of his 74 years in South African prisons. He talked in Johannesburg with FORTUNE managing editor Marshall Loeb about the future he foresees for South Africa's economy and the important role foreign business will play.

No. Our preoccupation is manufacturing and infrastructure, because these two areas will provide the most employment opportunities. What do you mean by infrastructure?  We have many areas where there are no roads, where there are no schools, where there is no electricity, no running water.

Interview by Marshall Loeb; reporter associate Jane Furth July 12, 1993. A NEW ERA IS DAWNING in relations between the U.S. and South Africa. Full- scale trade and investment will soon resume, as Nelson Mandela calls for an end to all sanctions. Almost certainly, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress will become the first black President of his country after the first truly universal elections are held next spring. On the eve of his visit to the U.S. to receive the Liberty Medal, Mandela was vigorous and erect despite having spent 27 of his 74 years in South African prisons. He talked in Johannesburg with FORTUNE managing editor Marshall Loeb about the future he foresees for South Africa\'s economy and the important role foreign business will play. Excerpts: Q: What are your plans for the economy, and what kinds of foreign companies would you like to see come into or expand in the new South Africa?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nThat is something I have gone out of my way to achieve. I have issued an express invitation to American businessmen to come and invest in our country. So that headline would be accurate. We have said that as soon as a transitional executive council is installed and as soon as a date of election has been fixed, then all financial sanctions should be lifted. We have already agreed on naming a transitional executive council and have set a tentative date for elections -- April 27, 1994. Once that date is confirmed, we will make a call to lift sanctions. There are about 160 U.S. states, counties, and cities that have restrictions on dealing with South Africa. How will you appeal to them? We have already started a drive to get states and communities that have legislation to consider repealing it. Once the date is firm, we will go full steam ahead and urge them to lift those bans. Should FORTUNE 500 companies start getting ready to invest in South Africa?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nWe have been having discussions with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. I have the impression that they are willing to come in and help us as soon as we are able to invite them. And I take it that U.S. commercial banks are ready to come as soon as we give the signal that sanctions can be lifted. Given the tremendous competition for investment in the world, why should any business invest in South Africa?  This country is rich in natural resources. We have a wide variety of precious metals, including gold. What has been neglected are the human resources -- people who have been denied the opportunities for education and training. And once these resources have been developed, this place would be a mecca. South Africa can be a powerhouse for Africa, certainly for Africa south of the equator. Is the Western world interested in introducing democratic | values in Africa? It cannot be done with Africa in debt and its economy in shambles. South Africa can play a very important role in ensuring economic stability. That is why the West should have an interest in investing here. Are you saying that the new South Africa will have 28 million black consumers who once were unable to buy almost anything?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nWe would hope that they will unbundle on their own. Although state intervention is something that is known throughout the world, we would like to avoid it except where it is absolutely necessary. Some form of intervention may be needed. For example, you have 85% of the population owning only 13% of the land, and a minority of 15% owning 87%. That is something that must be rectified, and state action may be necessary. We could do it without nationalization, without depriving individual owners of their land. There are vast tracts of barren land owned by the SADF ((South African Defense Forces)). That is absolutely unnecessary. We will be forming a democratic government that is committed to peace. We don\'t need a large army or vast pieces of land. That land can then be made available for individual ownership by people who have been denied that opportunity. It can also be used to address the claims of people who were removed by force and to ensure that there is equitable distribution of land in the country. What other steps can you take?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nUndoubtedly. There is a vast potential market, which just needs to be tapped. Is there a role for joint ventures between South African and foreign companies?  Yes, we would welcome that. Are there any sectors of the South African economy that you feel foreign companies should not invest in?  No. Our preoccupation is manufacturing and infrastructure, because these two areas will provide the most employment opportunities. What do you mean by infrastructure?  We have many areas where there are no roads, where there are no schools, where there is no electricity, no running water. Infrastructure would also include ambitious housing schemes, because millions of our people are without accommodation. That is why the whole country is littered with what are called squatter camps, informal settlements. How do you spread stock ownership among the people? Do you see companies distributing shares to employees?  I will not go into detail, but making shares available to everybody would be an important step in giving the people a stake in business. That is a move we will look at. Have you any concluding comments on your dreams for the new South Africa and how business people can help?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 2:\nThe way forward threatens to be complicated for Africa’s most advanced economy <https://apnews.com/hub/south-africa>, and there’s no coalition on the table yet. The three main opposition parties and many more smaller ones were in the mix as the bargaining begins.\n\n“We can talk to anybody and everybody,” ANC Chairman Gwede Mantashe said on national broadcaster SABC.\n\nSteenhuisen\'s Democratic Alliance was on around 21% of the vote. The new MK Party <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-zuma-anc-mk-6b18554612c5f6ff636f84352cbecdd5> of former President Jacob Zuma, who has turned against the ANC he once led, was third with just over 14% of the vote in the first election it has contested. The Economic Freedom Fighters was fourth with just over 9%.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nMore than 50 parties <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-ramaphosa-anc-parties-44187959a44ddaddadd0ad4b23bebd83> contested the election, many of them winning tiny shares, but the three main opposition parties appear to be the most obvious for the ANC to approach <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-vote-explainer-anc-ramaphosa-0e7600dc16bd51e3b6faa6cef6455e24>.\n\nElectoral commission Chairman Mosotho Moepya said it was a time for everyone to keep calm “and for leaders to lead and for voices of reason to continue to prevail.”\n\n"This is a moment we need to manage and manage well," he said.\n\nSteenhuisen said his party is open to discussions with the ANC, as did Malema. The MK Party said one of their conditions for any agreement was that Ramaphosa is removed as ANC leader and president. That underlined the fierce personal political battle between Zuma, who resigned as South African president under a cloud of corruption allegations in 2018, and Ramaphosa, who replaced him.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nPeople lined up deep into the cold winter night on election day and hours after the official poll closing time, with some votes being cast at 3 a.m. the following day. That indicated the desire from many to have their say, but also reflected one of South Africa\'s inherent problems <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-power-cuts-electricity-corruption-c86b3db8bce962cd8b0fa672310d95aa> — some voting stations had delays because of electricity outages plunging them into the dark.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com <https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/>\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nThe African National Congress <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-anc-decline-cf154312e3dc5c1b5ee615b82ba0c080> party lost its parliamentary majority in a historic election result Saturday that puts South Africa on a new political path for the first time since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule 30 years ago.\n\nWith more than 99% of votes counted, the once-dominant ANC <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-elections-voter-guide-6876f39a9c14a61c8f94f123cb66d4ce> had received just over 40% in Wednesday\'s election, well short of the majority it had held since the famed all-race vote of 1994 that ended apartheid and brought it to power <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-apartheid-freedom-democracy-election-d9269650c2d2c813e9794fda145ef22d> under Nelson Mandela.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nDA says an ANC-MK-EFF agreement would be a “doomsday coalition” given MK and EFF are made up of former ANC figures and would pursue the same failed policies.\n\nThe three opposition parties had a combined share that was bigger than the ANC, but they are highly unlikely to all work together. The DA was also part of a preelection agreement with other smaller parties to potentially form a coalition.\n\nAmid it all, there was no sense of celebrations from ordinary South Africans, but rather the realization that a rocky political road was ahead.

Interview by Marshall Loeb; reporter associate Jane Furth July 12, 1993. A NEW ERA IS DAWNING in relations between the U.S. and South Africa. Full- scale trade and investment will soon resume, as Nelson Mandela calls for an end to all sanctions. Almost certainly, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress will become the first black President of his country after the first truly universal elections are held next spring. On the eve of his visit to the U.S. to receive the Liberty Medal, Mandela was vigorous and erect despite having spent 27 of his 74 years in South African prisons. He talked in Johannesburg with FORTUNE managing editor Marshall Loeb about the future he foresees for South Africa\'s economy and the important role foreign business will play. Excerpts: Q: What are your plans for the economy, and what kinds of foreign companies would you like to see come into or expand in the new South Africa?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nThat is something I have gone out of my way to achieve. I have issued an express invitation to American businessmen to come and invest in our country. So that headline would be accurate. We have said that as soon as a transitional executive council is installed and as soon as a date of election has been fixed, then all financial sanctions should be lifted. We have already agreed on naming a transitional executive council and have set a tentative date for elections -- April 27, 1994. Once that date is confirmed, we will make a call to lift sanctions. There are about 160 U.S. states, counties, and cities that have restrictions on dealing with South Africa. How will you appeal to them? We have already started a drive to get states and communities that have legislation to consider repealing it. Once the date is firm, we will go full steam ahead and urge them to lift those bans. Should FORTUNE 500 companies start getting ready to invest in South Africa?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nWe have been having discussions with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. I have the impression that they are willing to come in and help us as soon as we are able to invite them. And I take it that U.S. commercial banks are ready to come as soon as we give the signal that sanctions can be lifted. Given the tremendous competition for investment in the world, why should any business invest in South Africa?  This country is rich in natural resources. We have a wide variety of precious metals, including gold. What has been neglected are the human resources -- people who have been denied the opportunities for education and training. And once these resources have been developed, this place would be a mecca. South Africa can be a powerhouse for Africa, certainly for Africa south of the equator. Is the Western world interested in introducing democratic | values in Africa? It cannot be done with Africa in debt and its economy in shambles. South Africa can play a very important role in ensuring economic stability. That is why the West should have an interest in investing here. Are you saying that the new South Africa will have 28 million black consumers who once were unable to buy almost anything?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nWe would hope that they will unbundle on their own. Although state intervention is something that is known throughout the world, we would like to avoid it except where it is absolutely necessary. Some form of intervention may be needed. For example, you have 85% of the population owning only 13% of the land, and a minority of 15% owning 87%. That is something that must be rectified, and state action may be necessary. We could do it without nationalization, without depriving individual owners of their land. There are vast tracts of barren land owned by the SADF ((South African Defense Forces)). That is absolutely unnecessary. We will be forming a democratic government that is committed to peace. We don\'t need a large army or vast pieces of land. That land can then be made available for individual ownership by people who have been denied that opportunity. It can also be used to address the claims of people who were removed by force and to ensure that there is equitable distribution of land in the country. What other steps can you take?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nUndoubtedly. There is a vast potential market, which just needs to be tapped. Is there a role for joint ventures between South African and foreign companies?  Yes, we would welcome that. Are there any sectors of the South African economy that you feel foreign companies should not invest in?  No. Our preoccupation is manufacturing and infrastructure, because these two areas will provide the most employment opportunities. What do you mean by infrastructure?  We have many areas where there are no roads, where there are no schools, where there is no electricity, no running water. Infrastructure would also include ambitious housing schemes, because millions of our people are without accommodation. That is why the whole country is littered with what are called squatter camps, informal settlements. How do you spread stock ownership among the people? Do you see companies distributing shares to employees?  I will not go into detail, but making shares available to everybody would be an important step in giving the people a stake in business. That is a move we will look at.

The three main opposition parties and many more smaller ones were in the mix as the bargaining begins.\n\n“We can talk to anybody and everybody,” ANC Chairman Gwede Mantashe said on national broadcaster SABC.\n\nSteenhuisen\'s Democratic Alliance was on around 21% of the vote. The new MK Party <https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-zuma-anc-mk-6b18554612c5f6ff636f84352cbecdd5> of former President Jacob Zuma, who has turned against the ANC he once led, was third with just over 14% of the vote in the first election it has contested.

The MK Party said one of their conditions for any agreement was that Ramaphosa is removed as ANC leader and president. That underlined the fierce personal political battle between Zuma, who resigned as South African president under a cloud of corruption allegations in 2018, and Ramaphosa, who replaced him.\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/south-africa-election-african-national-congress-majority-coalition-government-cyril-ramaphosa/\n\nSource 2:\nPeople lined up deep into the cold winter night on election day and hours after the official poll closing time, with some votes being cast at 3 a.m. the following day.

The DA was also part of a preelection agreement with other smaller parties to potentially form a coalition.\n\nAmid it all, there was no sense of celebrations from ordinary South Africans, but rather the realization that a rocky political road was ahead.

Interview by Marshall Loeb; reporter associate Jane Furth July 12, 1993. A NEW ERA IS DAWNING in relations between the U.S. and South Africa. Full- scale trade and investment will soon resume, as Nelson Mandela calls for an end to all sanctions. Almost certainly, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress will become the first black President of his country after the first truly universal elections are held next spring. On the eve of his visit to the U.S. to receive the Liberty Medal, Mandela was vigorous and erect despite having spent 27 of his 74 years in South African prisons. He talked in Johannesburg with FORTUNE managing editor Marshall Loeb about the future he foresees for South Africa\'s economy and the important role foreign business will play. Excerpts: Q: What are your plans for the economy, and what kinds of foreign companies would you like to see come into or expand in the new South Africa?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nThat is something I have gone out of my way to achieve. I have issued an express invitation to American businessmen to come and invest in our country. So that headline would be accurate. We have said that as soon as a transitional executive council is installed and as soon as a date of election has been fixed, then all financial sanctions should be lifted. We have already agreed on naming a transitional executive council and have set a tentative date for elections -- April 27, 1994. Once that date is confirmed, we will make a call to lift sanctions. There are about 160 U.S. states, counties, and cities that have restrictions on dealing with South Africa. How will you appeal to them? We have already started a drive to get states and communities that have legislation to consider repealing it. Once the date is firm, we will go full steam ahead and urge them to lift those bans. Should FORTUNE 500 companies start getting ready to invest in South Africa?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nWe have been having discussions with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. I have the impression that they are willing to come in and help us as soon as we are able to invite them. And I take it that U.S. commercial banks are ready to come as soon as we give the signal that sanctions can be lifted. Given the tremendous competition for investment in the world, why should any business invest in South Africa?  This country is rich in natural resources. We have a wide variety of precious metals, including gold. What has been neglected are the human resources -- people who have been denied the opportunities for education and training. And once these resources have been developed, this place would be a mecca. South Africa can be a powerhouse for Africa, certainly for Africa south of the equator. Is the Western world interested in introducing democratic | values in Africa? It cannot be done with Africa in debt and its economy in shambles. South Africa can play a very important role in ensuring economic stability. That is why the West should have an interest in investing here. Are you saying that the new South Africa will have 28 million black consumers who once were unable to buy almost anything?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nWe would hope that they will unbundle on their own. Although state intervention is something that is known throughout the world, we would like to avoid it except where it is absolutely necessary. Some form of intervention may be needed. For example, you have 85% of the population owning only 13% of the land, and a minority of 15% owning 87%. That is something that must be rectified, and state action may be necessary. We could do it without nationalization, without depriving individual owners of their land. There are vast tracts of barren land owned by the SADF ((South African Defense Forces)). That is absolutely unnecessary. We will be forming a democratic government that is committed to peace. We don\'t need a large army or vast pieces of land. That land can then be made available for individual ownership by people who have been denied that opportunity. It can also be used to address the claims of people who were removed by force and to ensure that there is equitable distribution of land in the country. What other steps can you take?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 1:\nUndoubtedly. There is a vast potential market, which just needs to be tapped. Is there a role for joint ventures between South African and foreign companies?  Yes, we would welcome that. Are there any sectors of the South African economy that you feel foreign companies should not invest in?  No. Our preoccupation is manufacturing and infrastructure, because these two areas will provide the most employment opportunities. What do you mean by infrastructure?  We have many areas where there are no roads, where there are no schools, where there is no electricity, no running water. Infrastructure would also include ambitious housing schemes, because millions of our people are without accommodation. That is why the whole country is littered with what are called squatter camps, informal settlements. How do you spread stock ownership among the people? Do you see companies distributing shares to employees?  I will not go into detail, but making shares available to everybody would be an important step in giving the people a stake in business. That is a move we will look at. Have you any concluding comments on your dreams for the new South Africa and how business people can help?\n\n\nurl: https://fortune.com/article/mandela-reaches-out-to-business-fortune-1993/\n\nSource 2:\nThe way forward threatens to be complicated for Africa’s most advanced economy <https://apnews.com/hub/south-africa>, and there’s no coalition on the table yet.

2024-11-08 06:46:25,502: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The first President of South Africa after the end of apartheid was Nelson Mandela. Mandela, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress (ANC), was poised to become the first black President of South Africa after the country's first truly universal elections, which were to be held in the spring of 1994 [1]. In fact, Mandela had already called for an end to all sanctions against South Africa, and full-scale trade and investment were expected to resume soon [1]. Mandela's leadership and vision for a new South Africa were instrumental in shaping the country's future, and his presidency marked a significant turning point in South African history.

Mandela's presidency was also notable for his efforts to promote economic development and stability in South Africa. He recognized the importance of foreign investment in helping to rebuild the country's economy, and he actively courted American businessmen to come and invest in South Africa [1]. Mandela also acknowledged the need for economic stability in Africa as a whole, stating that "it cannot be done with Africa in debt and its economy in shambles" [1]. His leadership and vision helped to establish South Africa as a key player in regional economic development.

Under Mandela's leadership, the ANC implemented policies aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing inequality. However, in recent years, the ANC has faced criticism for its handling of the economy, and the party has seen a decline in its support among voters [2]. Despite this, Mandela's legacy as a champion of democracy and economic development continues

2024-11-08 06:46:25,617: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The first President of South Africa after the end of apartheid was Nelson Mandela. Mandela, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress (ANC), was poised to become the first black President of South Africa after the country's first truly universal elections, which were to be held in the spring of 1994 [1]. In fact, Mandela had already called for an end to all sanctions against South Africa, and full-scale trade and investment were expected to resume soon [1]. Mandela's leadership and vision for a new South Africa were instrumental in shaping the country's future, and his presidency marked a significant turning point in South African history.

Mandela's presidency was also notable for his efforts to promote economic development and stability in South Africa. He recognized the importance of foreign investment in helping to rebuild the country's economy, and he actively courted American businessmen to come and invest in South Africa [1]. Mandela also acknowledged the need for economic stability in Africa as a whole, stating that "it cannot be done with Africa in debt and its economy in shambles" [1]. His leadership and vision helped to establish South Africa as a key player in regional economic development.

Under Mandela's leadership, the ANC implemented policies aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing inequality. However, in recent years, the ANC has faced criticism for its handling of the economy, and the party has seen a decline in its support among voters [2]. Despite this, Mandela's legacy as a champion of democracy and economic development continues to be celebrated in South Africa

2024-11-08 06:46:26,468: ObserveEventsHandler(  198): MEASUREMENT: LLMChatInProgress response: assistant: The first President of South Africa after the end of apartheid was Nelson Mandela. Mandela, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress (ANC), was poised to become the first black President of South Africa after the country's first truly universal elections, which were to be held in the spring of 1994 [1]. In fact, Mandela had already called for an end to all sanctions against South Africa, and full-scale trade and investment were expected to resume soon [1]. Mandela's leadership and vision for a new South Africa were instrumental in shaping the country's future, and his presidency marked a significant turning point in South African history.

Mandela's presidency was also notable for his efforts to promote economic development and stability in South Africa. He recognized the importance of foreign investment in helping to rebuild the country's economy, and he actively courted American businessmen to come and invest in South Africa [1]. Mandela also acknowledged the need for economic stability in Africa as a whole, stating that "it cannot be done with Africa in debt and its economy in shambles" [1]. His leadership and vision helped to establish South Africa as a key player in regional economic development.

Under Mandela's leadership, the ANC implemented policies aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing inequality. However, in recent years, the ANC has faced criticism for its handling of the economy, and the party has seen a decline in its support among voters [2]. Despite this, Mandela's legacy as a champion of democracy and economic development continues to be celebrated in South Africa and around the world.
