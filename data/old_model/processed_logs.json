        "LLM_question": "Why are bees important to ecosystems?",
        "LLM_answer": "Bees are crucial to ecosystems because they play a vital role in pollination. As pollinators, bees help make up to one out of every three bites of food that humans eat [2]. Without bees, many plants would be unable to reproduce, and food production would suffer significantly. In fact, the impact of declining bee populations is already being felt, with many beekeepers going out of business due to unfair competition from adulterated honey [3]. This not only affects the beekeeping industry but also has a ripple effect on the entire ecosystem.",

Similarly, if we were too focused on the benefits of Wi-Fi alone (the current honey), we would have missed the need for seamless connectivity across Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellite networks.

Hassabis is the CEO of Google\u2019s DeepMind <https://fortune.com/company/deepmind/> AI unit, while Jumper is a director there.\\n\\nThe pair received the award for their work on the AlphaFold 2 AI model, which in 2020 stunned the scientific world <https://fortune.com/2020/11/30/deepmind-solved-protein-folding-alphafold/> with its ability to correctly predict the structure of almost all known proteins from their DNA sequences. Previously, computer software was much less accurate at predicting protein structures, while imaging methods to discover the shape of proteins were time-consuming and costly.\\n\\nThis breakthrough was hugely impactful since proteins are the engines behind most biological processes, with their shape determining their function. Among other things, being able to predict the shape of a protein unlocks better understanding of disease and could enable researchers to more quickly develop new drugs.",

For example, it took Mayo Clinic <https://fortune.com/company/mayo-clinic/> researchers in the United States just six weeks <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00147-9/fulltext> to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases. This experience, though enabled by the exceptional circumstance of a global pandemic <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-023-00773-0>, is still illustrative of the power of sharing. But if the rise in data regulation continues at its current rate, such cross-border data sharing will become more and more difficult. This would have major implications, both on the global economy and on our collective ability to address issues that can only be solved by using data from multiple countries, such as anticipating natural disasters",

As patterns of competition change and artificially protected preserves are opened up, weak firms must seek shelter or get trampled upon and strong ones cannot take their strength for granted. Yet everyone seems to be looking forward with gusto to the test. A few businessmen expressed concern about what the Common Market might do to their immediate prospects, but none even hinted that he would like to see the process stopped or reversed. The business community that started out with the best reasons to be frightened now embraces the new adventure with the most enthusiasm. A few years ago France looked like the weak sister of Europe.

According to Katherine Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, creating and consuming art is tied to wellness, as it \"makes us happy\" and \"makes it possible for us to express emotion\" [1]. Art also has the ability to reduce stress and anxiety, with research showing that looking at art can lower blood pressure and give us an endorphin rush [1]. This emotional resonance is a key factor in art's impact on culture, as it allows us to tap into our shared human experiences and connect with others on a deeper level.",

Web3 blockchains empower and are owned by individuals, whether consumers or creators\u2014rather than leaving them and their data at the mercy of dominant players like Microsoft/OpenAI, Google, and all those other LLM developers treating our data as raw material for their business models. \\n\\nBlockchains are essentially a system of contracts operating as a public, immutable ledger that can protect intellectual property.

Before their armies invaded Europe, everything had been figured out, except the actual course of events. That the Allies would have to arrive with civilian supplies, with food and raw materials, was generally understood. So the U.S. and Great Britain pooled the economic brain trusters of the two General Staffs to produce a minimum plan. Basing their calculations on years of research that had gone into the Allied Minimum Imports Program (a combined planning venture of all United Nations), the brain trusters of the General Staffs emerged with three hypotheses and three corresponding requirement plans. Plan A assumed the Germans would retire in a hurry and without scorching. Plan B assessed the supply requirements if the Germans were continually driven back, but had sufficient time to scorch. Plan C figured on very slow progress and complete destruction of painfully conquered territories. The military did what military would do. They first found out how much shipping space and how many supplies they thought they could do without, and then picked the plan that fitted this arithmetic. Sure enough, it was Plan A, with a few items of Plan B thrown in for good measure. Reality, as it happened, resembled much more a",

Deadpool & Wolverine is scheduled to be released in the US in July.\\n\\nAnother franchise Disney acquired as part of the Fox deal was Avatar. The second film, released in 2022, was also cleared by Chinese regulators and became the third-highest-grossing movie in history, with $2.3 billion in ticket sales. \\n\\nOn June 14, Disney released Inside Out 2, generating a $295 million global haul in ticket sales that scored the biggest opening weekend in history for an animated film.",

The Congo Basin forests, for example, are a critical ecosystem that supports life for 300 million rural Africans in surrounding regions [2]. The forests also play a crucial role in regulating the climate, with the Congo Basin containing roughly 40% of the carbon stock of the Amazon, despite being only one-third the size [2].

When, by a unique, bold decision, one eastern private college raised its tuition fee to substantially 100% of the cost of teaching, it simultaneously notified parents that acceptable students could get grants-in-aid (discounts, in effect) if their families could not pay in full. One father thereupon entered his daughter in a neighboring college, haughtily declaring that he wanted no charity. But the neighbor\\'s tuition charge, which Daddy proudly paid \"in full,\" was almost $400 under cost. U.S. higher education is, in fact, an enormous charity. Though board and lodging are usually charged for at cost, an insignificant number -- possibly none -- of the three million students, even at the most expensive institutions, pay the full cost of their instruction proper (at the exceptional college cited above, costs have since overtaken fees once again). All get a standard discount, its size depending on the local cost level, the institution\\'s wealth, and how eager the institution is to attract talented students who may lack the cash to pay full costs. Campus cost accounting is still largely a primitive art, so that figures must be accepted with caution, but it is probable that the private institutions\\' standard discounts average about $500 a",

Faust, formerly a dean at the University of Chicago and now both president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education and vice president in charge of education for the Ford Foundation, has outlined a plan that would give students an assignment to study independently off the campus for one-quarter of each year. This would increase the number a given plant could handle. Would the system detract from the quality of education? Dr. Faust believes not. \"The pressure of numbers may be the occasion for important improvements in college education,\" he says. Dr. Faust rejects the old assumption that the only way to learn is in a group, taking a formal course. Many educators agree that U.S. college students show inadequate initiative because they are conditioned in high school to study only specific assignments, and are brought up \"in the lock step of class lectures, recitations, deadlines for papers and reports, and course examinations.\" Dr. Faust would reduce student-teacher contact. This could be done by having students spend several months working on their own, after a month or so of lectures that would identify the nature of problems involved in a given subject and would indicate how \"a sharp,",

Perhaps the most radical pedagogical suggestion is the use of television, which the Fund for the Advancement of Education has been pushing assiduously. TV can effectively present not only uniquely talented lecturers to students anywhere, but also a wide range of audio-visual materials, including costly equipment, art originals, operational techniques in surgery, engineering, etc. Three years of experiment at Pennsylvania State showed that in many subjects TV students somewhat surpassed those taught conventionally.

There might well be many lenders and borrowers. College training today is quite another commodity from that dispensed in early U.S. colleges, which were set up primarily to produce preachers and teachers, whom society, then as now, esteemed but underpaid. Today a college education is an investment that adds an average of $100,000 to graduates\\' lifetime earnings. Retroactive scholarships could be provided to cover educational debts of those who become teachers, preachers, or members of other poorly paid professions. Princeton University has some scholarships of this type now, and some states with programs of teacher-training tuition loans forgive the debt in return for teaching service after graduation.

One such, Ricardo A. Mestres, treasurer of Princeton, found educators cool to his slogan, \"Study now, pay later,\" but largely on grounds of feasibility rather than principle. Another, Ernest van den Haag, a former businessman now teaching economics and sociology at New York University, last year expanded his ideas into a book, Education as an Industry. He contends that a system of higher education based on credit liberal enough to cover all tuition and living expenses would tend to increase educational opportunity and also to equalize it. He suggests starting a loan scheme in professional schools where \"the effect of education on alumni income is most uniform, obvious, and extensive.\" Van den Haag would have the colleges lend to, or as he sees it, invest in students after raising capital by selling bonds, or simply endorse students\\' notes and rediscount them.

        "LLM_question": "Why do economic recessions occur?",
        "LLM_answer": "Economic recessions occur due to a combination of factors that ultimately lead to a decline in economic activity. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, recessions can build slowly and then come quickly [8]. One of the key indicators of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which can trigger a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule [1]. This rule is triggered when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more over a 12-month period, which occurred recently when the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% [1].",
        "LLM_query": "What are the underlying causes of economic recessions, and how do they impact the global economy?",

                "text": "After repeatedly surprising experts with its resilience, the U.S. economy has recently shown signs of a sharp slowdown. The July employment report came in far weaker than anticipated last week, with the U.S. economy adding 114,000 jobs, compared to economists\u2019 consensus forecast for 175,000. The unemployment also rose to 4.3%, triggering one of the most accurate recession indicators, the infamous Sahm Rule.\\n\\n\u201cThe immediate implication is that investors fear that the economy may weaken rapidly and want the Fed to cut rates aggressively to maintain economic growth,\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s Christopher explained. \\n\\nHowever, the global stock market rout began in Japan on Monday, where the Nikkei 225 plunged 12% in its worst day since 1987. And some say the so-called \u201ccarry trade\u201d may be to blame for Japan\u2019s dark Monday. \\n\\nFor years, traders have borrowed money in Japan, where interest rates are low, and then used that money to buy assets abroad. But with the Bank of Japan now raising interest rates last week, and most Western nations lowering interest rates, that trade isn\u2019t what it used to be.",

                "text": "\"neutrals,\" are militarily defenseless in the ordinary sense. At best they will acquire destructive capabilities of their own, as Britain is now doing. Consequently, the \"concert of powers\"--or its equivalent international organization--rests on a basis much more fragile than ever before. The situation is further embroiled by the newly achieved political effectiveness of non-European nationalisms. These factors would \"normally\"--that is, in any recent century--have led to war. Will they lead to war before 1980? Or soon thereafter? It would be presumptuous to try to answer such a question firmly. In any case, the present and the near future are both dangerous. While the immediate problem is to cope with the actual danger, it is also essential to envisage how the problem is going to evolve in the 1955-80 period, even assuming that all will go reasonably well for the moment. This does not mean belittling immediate problems of weaponry, of U.S.-U.S.S.R. tensions, of the evolution and revolutions of Asia. These first things must come first. But we must be ready for the follow-up, lest possible immediate successes prove futile. We must think beyond the present forms of problems to those of later decades.",

Since 1945, improved aeronautics and communications alone might have sufficed to make any geographical unit, including Russia, inadequate in a future war. The advent of nuclear weapons merely climaxes the development. Now the effectiveness of offensive weapons is such as to stultify all plausible defensive time scales. As early as World War I, it was observed that the admiral commanding the battle fleet could \"lose the British Empire in one afternoon.\" Yet navies of that epoch were relatively stable entities, tolerably safe against technological surprises. Today there is every reason to fear that even minor inventions and feints in the field of nuclear weapons can be decisive in less time than would be required to devise specific countermeasures. Soon existing nations will be as unstable in war as a nation the size of Manhattan Island would have been in a contest fought with the weapons of 1900. Such military instability has already found its political expression. Two superpowers, the U.S. and U.S.S.R., represent such enormous destructive potentials as to afford little chance of a purely passive equilibrium. Other countries, including possible \"neutrals,\" are militarily defenseless in the ordinary sense. At best they will acquire",

Companies were starting to build the crafts that would enable U.S. astronauts to fly. Then as now, scientists and government officials debated the costs and benefits of space travel and the possibility of discovering life. \"...Suppose when we get to the moon we find sitting in the middle of a crater a strange little marker bearing a carefully chiseled but totally incomprehensible inscription,\" one scientist told Fortune writer Bello; \"Then space would really get exciting.\" By Francis Bello Anyone who has wondered what it was like to live in the era that followed Columbus\\' voyage to America now has his chance to find out. Then, as now, thoughtful men disputed the merits of pressing into the unknown, argued that the possible fruits could not justify the cost, warned that the hazards to life and limb were immense. And then as now, the young, the venturesome, and the insatiably curious plunged ahead. \"What we are witnessing,\" says one prominent member of the President\\'s Science Advisory Committee, \"is another irresistible urge of the human race.

The great multi-engine vehicle known as Saturn will be needed to scoop up samples of lunar rock and dust and fly them back to earth. Having missed a good opportunity this past month to fire a deep space probe to the vicinity of Venus, because its space vehicles were not ready, NASA will now have to wait until January, 1961, when earth and Venus will again be in suitable juxtaposition.

For one, it would open up new opportunities for economic growth, as the space industry is expected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035 [2]. This growth would not only benefit the companies directly involved in space travel but also have a ripple effect on other industries, such as logistics and manufacturing. For instance, companies like Astrolab are already working on developing rovers that can operate on interplanetary bodies, which could enable industrial activity on the moon and other celestial bodies [3].",

The justifications given for going into space have no more relevance than the desire for spices had for the discovery <https://fortune.com/company/discovery-insurance/> of America.\" Privately, and sometimes openly, many scientists deplore the fact that enormous funds are going into space when there are so many unfinished problems, both scientific and human, lying much closer at hand. One persuasive answer to this viewpoint is offered by Herbert F. York, the young physicist who is Director of Defense Research and Engineering. \"Everyone would agree,\" he says, \"that we should be trying to raise the standard of living in India, and building dams in the Middle East. But no one is asking us to choose between dams and space--we could easily afford both. The space effort isn\\'t a plot; it\\'s something that appeals to a great many people for a great many reasons.\" No one has responded to space more spontaneously and enthusiastically than U.S. industry. And the vigor of the response is out of all proportion to the money to be made in the space business, at least. in the foreseeable future.

In fact, Mandela had already called for an end to all sanctions against South Africa, and full-scale trade and investment were expected to resume soon [1]. Mandela's leadership and vision for a new South Africa were instrumental in shaping the country's future, and his presidency marked a significant turning point in South African history.",

Full- scale trade and investment will soon resume, as Nelson Mandela calls for an end to all sanctions. Almost certainly, the charismatic leader of the African National Congress will become the first black President of his country after the first truly universal elections are held next spring. On the eve of his visit to the U.S. to receive the Liberty Medal, Mandela was vigorous and erect despite having spent 27 of his 74 years in South African prisons. He talked in Johannesburg with FORTUNE managing editor Marshall Loeb about the future he foresees for South Africa's economy and the important role foreign business will play.

Given the tremendous competition for investment in the world, why should any business invest in South Africa?  This country is rich in natural resources.

Is the Western world interested in introducing democratic | values in Africa? It cannot be done with Africa in debt and its economy in shambles.

Go for the options with more fiber and less sugar, fat and sodium. \\n\\nBeyond Meat recently announced that they\u2019ve reformulated their burger and ground beef alternatives to replace coconut and canola oils with avocado oil, bringing the saturated fat content down by 60% to just 2 grams per serving. The new formulation, scheduled to arrive in supermarkets in June, also cuts sodium by 20%. \\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that our products are similar to or lower in sodium than plain ground beef once you add salt or a seasoning blend [to plain ground beef], which most people do during the cooking process,\u201d says Joy Bauer, RDN, nutrition advisor to Beyond Meat.",

The first fruits of this program were the two Discoverer satellites launched from the new Vandenberg Base last February and April, which placed record U.S. payloads in the difficult polar orbit. In addition to Sentry and Discoverer, which are now separate but related projects, Lockheed is also in charge of Midas--a satellite system to provide ballistic-missile early warning.

Premier Khrushchev once proposed that the U.S. and Russia compete in a friendly \"shooting match\" to test the accuracy of the ICBM\\'s of the two nations. The space contest actually in progress is more pervasive and far more fateful for world history than the match Khrushchev proposed. And, on the record to date, Russia is ahead.

When President Eisenhower, in March, 1958, issued the report entitled \"Introduction to Outer Space,\" prepared by his Science Advisory Committee--and urged Americans to read it--he observed, \"This is not science fiction.

From nose cones to satellites To keep the IRBM and ICBM program on its incredibly tight schedule, a high-level government decision was made in 1955 not to allot any of the military missiles to the I.G.Y. program for space exploration. Instead, the nonmilitary Martin Vanguard, based on the Viking--a high-altitude or \"sounding\" rocket--was designated to loft the nation\\'s first satellite. The Naval Research Laboratory was given a parsimonious $20 million for the project, which has now absorbed over $120 million. Chafing under this decision, Major General John B.

This is because gravity is what keeps us and everything else on the ground, and without it, the concept of \"up\" and \"down\" would lose all meaning.

In this view, continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials, like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel, and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle. Indeed, according to a famous computation by Lord Kelvin, the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel. Hence, except for some local fluidities, the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic, like steel. This concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in 1960 from a totally unexpected quarter-space. Observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites, which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas, led to two important though still controversial discoveries. One was that the earth is slightly pear-shaI1 d, bulging more below the equator than above. Small as this f\\' regularity is, it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials. The second discovery was that there are extensive irregularities in gravity over the earth, like great shallow hills and bowls. Eight major gravity anomalies have been located, the two greatest being a deep depression or \"bowl\"",

To sustain such gross irregularities in shape and mass without breaking apart, the earth must be exceedingly rigid and strong. The strains generated by these anomalies, according to space geodesists, must go down to the very core of the earth. They are so great that, to account for them, some have refurbished the theory, first suggested by George Darwin, that a great catastrophe once tore a huge mass out of what \u00b7is now the Pacific Ocean to form the moon and perhaps Mars. A more plausible hypothesis, suggested by Gordon J. F.

This lag stores vast tension or energy in the earth, like a coiled spring, accounting for all the shifts in its crust, including earthquakes. In this clash of theories, science progresses.

The main driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [1]. Additionally, human-caused climate change is also driven by the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from activities such as agriculture, especially livestock farming [5]. In fact, livestock farming alone contributed around 12% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [5].",

According to recent data, the yen has been experiencing a significant decline in value, briefly touching a 34-year low compared to the U.S. dollar [2]. This decline has been attributed to various factors, including the interest rate differential between Japan and other countries, particularly the U.S. [2].

First, because of Japan\u2019s low interest rates, the yen is often used in the so-called \u201ccarry trade.\u201d That\u2019s when investors borrow at a low interest rate to invest in an asset with a higher return. \\n\\nFor example, a fund manager might borrow yen and then invest that money in Indian bonds that offer a higher yield, pocketing the difference. It\u2019s slightly more complex than this in practice, as the fund manager in question would also need to swap rupees for dollars, and hedge his dollar risk, but that\u2019s the general idea. \\n\\nAll of this means that when the interest-rate differentials between Japan and other major developed nations are high, traders will rush in to borrow yen for the carry trade, which weighs on the currency. And Bank of America\u2019s analysts warned in a Friday note that the carry trade \u201cis unlikely to start diminishing meaningfully until the Fed starts cutting rates, which our U.S. economists expect in December.\u201d",

For farmers of alfalfa and other crops that feed cattle, a surplus of hay due to good weather conditions can lead to a plummet in prices, making it more profitable for them to receive federal funding for not watering their crops rather than selling them [1]. This is the case for farmers like Trevor Tagg, who opted for a program that pays him to give up water rights for two months, as the price of alfalfa has dropped significantly over the past two years [1]. With a ton of hay now fetching only $100, compared to $400 a couple of years ago, farmers are left with little choice but to consider alternative options [1].",

                "text": "Right or wrong, his presidential dalliance had generated coverage and then some; Trump recounted how Don King, the furious-haired boxing promoter, called up to declare, \"This is the single greatest promotion I have ever seen!\" It was widely presumed, of course, that Trump\\'s political noodlings were just that: a promotion, a cynical ploy to sell books and condos\u2014politics as the continuation of salesmanship by other means, if you will. But after spending time with Trump over several weeks, I became convinced otherwise. The man seriously wanted to seek the American presidency\u2014to win, as he put it, \"the whole megillah.\" If that sounds far-fetched, it may be because you haven\\'t yet grasped the governing principles of the Trumpian universe. Consider, for instance, his beef with America\\'s trade representatives: It\\'s that they have low name recognition. \"Who are these people?\" Trump sputtered at one point. \"Nobody\\'s ever heard of them!\" As for candidates who had made less money than he: \"They\\'re losers. Who the hell wants to have a person like this for President?\" More famous, more money: To those who objected that he had no obvious qualifications for politics other than a Bob Dole-like tendency",

But the real puzzler is what, exactly, Donald Trump wants. As we walked through the half-gutted lobby of the General Motors <https://fortune.com/company/general-motors/> Building, Trump insisted he most wanted to be respected as a builder. \"The thing I do best is I build,\" he said. \"Everyone says, \\'Oh, Trump is a great promoter.\\' I don\\'t think I\\'m even a good promoter.

Martin Balsam\\'s question, originally applied to Holly Golightly, is just as central here. It is also appropriate: Trump, after all, is the man who purchased Tiffany\\'s air rights to clear the way for a monument to himself, Trump Tower, and thereupon replaced Holly as the most famous social climber ever to hang out at 57th and Fifth. But before examining that question, let us first pose another: Why all the current fascination with Donald Trump?\\nHe is only the 27th-largest developer in the U.S., according to Building Design and Construction magazine, and is not even the biggest in New York. He has built only three buildings in Manhattan; dozens of other developers have exerted more influence on Gotham\\'s skyline. As a corporate shark, the Great White Yuppie draws yawns on Wall Street. A takeover lawyer told Fortune (September 28): \"I haven\\'t the slightest idea what he\\'s doing. He\\'s in and out, in and out. It\\'s hard to separate the man from the publicity.\" He is certainly not the billionaire he claims he is, not by Fortune\u2019s reckoning (or Forbes\u2019s).",

In Trump\\'s reality show, The Apprentice, he and two lieutenants monitor contestants as they backstab their way to a $250,000-a-year job as president of one of his companies. In Trump\\'s real life he has managed--by force of personality, insane attention to certain details, charisma, bluntness, self-promotion, and connections--to build an empire of steel, marble, beauty pageants, casinos, and some of the most incredible moldings you\\'ll ever see.

He lives his life straight out of the Survivor handbook: Start with the truth, then add enough drama, celebrity, sex, and what might very charitably be called creative editing to make something entirely outlandish.

With exchange controls and capital controls, you can\u2019t just look at other markets to put your money into.\u201d\\n\\nAlthough China mines more gold than any other country, it still needs to import a lot and the quantities are getting larger. In the last two years, overseas purchases totaled over 2,800 tons \u2014 more than all of the metal that backs exchange-traded funds around the world, or about a third of the stockpiles held by the US Federal Reserve.\\n\\nEven so, the pace of shipments has accelerated lately. Imports surged in the run-up to China\u2019s Lunar New Year, a peak season for gifts, and over the first two months of the year are 53% higher than they were in 2023.",

By shedding ourselves of this monstrosity, America paved the way for its core values to guide us to become the greatest country in the world.

History will likely regard the 12 years between Nov. 9, 1989--the day the Berlin Wall collapsed, foreshadowing the demise of the Soviet Union--and Sept. 11, 2001, as an era of American frivolity and self-absorption. An era when many people in the U.S. decided the outside world, the world beyond our borders, no longer mattered--certainly not in a life-and-death sense, as when an \"evil empire\" threatened nuclear destruction. It was the economy, stupid. Those dozen years were, in truth, something of a silly season, and the silly season is over. Sept. 11, 2001, ended it. George W. Bush now presides over a country about to fight a highly unusual war. Just how daunting and different this war will be is evident from a simple fact: As this article is written, there is talk in Washington of a declaration of war against an enemy...that has",

However, I can tell you that U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, with a quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers [8]. Additionally, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, with 104.6 million passengers, according to Airports Council International [4]. This suggests that a US airline might be among the largest in terms of the number of passengers carried, but I don't have information on a specific airline.",

The Chinese economy is expected to decelerate to 4.8% this year from 5.2% in 2023.\\n\\nGrowth in Latin America is forecast to slow from 2.2% last year to 1.8% in 2024. The World Bank expects the economy of sub-Saharan Africa to grow 3.5%, modest but up from 3% last year.",

                "text": "Much of Hinton\u2019s worry stems from the belief that humanity knows frighteningly little about artificial intelligence\u2014and that machines may outsmart humans. \u201cThese things could get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over, and we need to worry now about how we prevent that happening,\u201d he said <https://www.npr.org/2023/05/28/1178673070/the-godfather-of-ai-sounds-alarm-about-potential-dangers-of-ai> in an interview with NPR.\\nOriginally from England, Hinton spent much of his professional life in the U.S. and Canada. It was at the University of Toronto where he reached a major breakthrough that would become the intellectual foundation for many contemporary uses of AI. In 2012, Hinton and two grad students (one of whom was Ilya Sutskever, the former chief scientist <https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/openai-sam-altman-geoffrey-hinton-nobel-prize-physics-ilya-sutskever-toronto/> at OpenAI) built a neural network that could identify basic objects in pictures. Google <https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/> eventually bought <https://www.wired.com/story/secret-auction-race-ai-supremacy-google-microsoft-baidu/> a company Hinton had started based on the tech for $44 million. Hinton then worked at Google for 10 years before retiring in 2023 to free himself from any corporate constraints that may have limited his ability to warn the public about AI. (Hinton did not respond to a request for comment.)",

For all its opportunities, AI presents grave dangers too. In Mastering AI, I detail many of these risks, some of which have not received the attention they deserve. Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don\u2019t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse. It will boost fraud, cybercrime, and misinformation. It will erode societal trust and hurt democracy. AI could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. All of these risks are present with AI technology that exists today. There is also a remote\u2014but not completely nonexistent\u2014chance that a superintelligent AI system could pose an existential risk to humanity. It would be wise to devote some effort to taking this last risk off the table, but we should not let these efforts distract or crowd out work we need to do to solve AI\u2019s more immediate",

He had failed to persuade senior colleagues at the thriving company to speed up plans to make low-cost, high-volume hardware for the much-ballyhooed information highway -- a move he considered critical to Silicon Graphics\\' long-term survival. \"I got tired of pushing against an immovable object,\" says Clark, 52. \"I felt like I wasn\\'t having any influence.\" But after he left, Clark didn\\'t know what to do with himself. At first he thought he might create a company to design software to provide interactive television services via phone lines or cable.

He grew up in Queens, New York, one of two children (he has a younger sister named Enid) of Fredric and Hannah Kurzweil, Viennese Jews who fled the Nazis in 1938. His parents encouraged their son\\'s ambition. \"Ideas were the religion of our household,\" he says. \"They saw science and technology as the way of the future and a way to make money and not struggle the way they did.\" Fredric, a composer and conductor, died of heart disease at 58, an event that would have a lasting impact on his son. Kurzweil discovered computers at age 12, and quickly demonstrated an amazing facility with technology. At 14 he wangled a job as the computer programmer at the research department of Head Start, the federal government\\'s early-childhood-development program. While there he wrote software that was later distributed by IBM <https://fortune.com/company/ibm/> (IBM) with its mainframes. At 17 he won an international science contest by building a computer that analyzed the works of Chopin and Beethoven to compose music; that trick landed him on the TV show",

According to reports, Bankman-Fried and other top executives at FTX looted customer accounts to make risky investments, millions of dollars of illegal political donations, bribe Chinese officials, and buy luxury real estate in the Caribbean [8]. This misuse of customer funds led to a significant shortfall in the company's assets, ultimately resulting in its collapse.",

Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don\u2019t get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse. It will boost fraud, cybercrime, and misinformation. It will erode societal trust and hurt democracy. AI could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. All of these risks are present with AI technology that exists today. There is also a remote\u2014but not completely nonexistent\u2014chance that a superintelligent AI system could pose an existential risk to humanity.

Top speed is 110 or more. At highway passing speeds the car leaps ahead where others run out of breath. But the performance seems even stronger than it is because of the car\\'s uncanny freedom from noise and vibration. Only a few luxury cars offer comparable sensations; with windows rolled up, the loudest sounds at seventy-five miles per hour are wind noise and the whine of transmission gears. The car does have its drawbacks. Drivers must learn to heed their tachometers, since the engine climbs so easily to high revolutions. Although the four-speed transmission is smooth, with gear ranges well suited to U.S. driving conditions, a stiff and \"grabby\" clutch exacerbates the problem of starting smoothly from a dead stop. Those who want automatic transmissions will have to wait until later this year. Owners have also complained that gas mileage, which averages between eighteen and twenty-three miles per gallon, is poor for a small car, and oil consumption averaging 1,400 miles a quart",
