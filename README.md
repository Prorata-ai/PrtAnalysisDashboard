# PrtAnalysisDashboard
This contains the implementation of the dashboard: an evaluation service to evaluate our systems.

The current version works with local logs. 
We have logs from local runs of the system stored at `data/' 
Running "Generate Logs" reads the logs and post-processes them for further analysis.
